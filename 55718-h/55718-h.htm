<p><span class="smcap">The</span> good American of the Twentieth century by no
means defers going to Paris until he dies, but anticipates
the joys of Paradise by making a familiarity with
the French capital one of the consolations that tend to
the alleviation of his enforced terrestrial sojourn. All
Europe, indeed, has become the pleasure-ground of American
tourists, a large proportion of whom fail to realize
that in our own country there are enchanted regions
in which the traveller feels that he has been caught
up in the starry immensities and heard the words not
lawful for man to utter. Within the limits of Colorado,
New Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
four centres of sublime and unparalleled scenic sublimity
which stand alone and unrivalled in the world. Neither
the Alps nor the Himalayas can offer any parallel to the phenomena
of the mountain and desert systems of the Southwest
as wrought by the march of ages, presenting unique
and incomparable problems of scientific interest that defy
solution, and which are inviting the constant study and
increasing research of many among the most eminent specialists
of the day in geology and metallurgy. The Pike's
Peak region offers to the traveller not only the ascent of the
stupendous Peak, but also the "Short Line" trip between
Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek, which affords forty-five
miles of marvellous mountain and cañon effects. The
engineering problem of the ascent of St. Peter's Dome,&mdash;a
huge mass of granite towering eleven thousand feet into
the air, around which the steel track winds in terraces, glory
after glory of view repeating itself from the ascending vistas
as the train climbs the dizzy height,&mdash;the engineering
problem that is here at once presented and solved, has
attracted scientific attention all over the world as the most
extraordinary achievement in mountain transportation.
The Grand Cañon of the Colorado in Arizona, two days'
journey from the Pike's Peak region, the Petrified Forests
that lie also in Arizona, seventy-five miles beyond the
border of New Mexico, and that Buried Star near Cañon
Diablo, make up a group that travellers and scientists
are beginning ardently to appreciate. Colorado, New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California offer, all in all,
a landscape panorama that for grandeur, charm of climate,
and rich and varied resources is unrivalled. Imagination
falters before the resources of this region and the inducements
it offers as a locality in which to live surrounded by
perpetual beauty. The air is all exhilaration; the deep
blue skies are a miracle of color by day, and a miracle
of shining firmament by night; the land offers its richly
varied returns in agriculture, fruit, mining, or grazing,
according to the specific locality; the inhabitants represent
the best quality of American life; the opportunities
and advantages already offered and constantly increasing
are greater than would at first be considered possible.
This entire Southwest can only be accurately defined as
the Land of Enchantment.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'</div>
<div class="verse">Gleams that untravell'd world,"</div>
</div></div>

<p>exclaims Tennyson's Ulysses, and the wanderer under
Western stars that hang, like blazing clusters of radiant
light, midway in the air, cannot but feel that all these
new experiences open to him vistas of untold significance
and undreamed-of inspiration.</p>

<p class="center">"It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,"</p>

<p>is the haunting refrain of his thoughts when, through the
luminous air, he gazes into the golden glory of sunsets
whose splendor is forever impressed on his memory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Every hour of the journey through the Southwest is
an hour of enchantment in the intense interest of the
scenes. One must not miss the outlook when descending
the steep grade down Raton Mountain; nor must he fail
to be on the alert in passing through the strange old
pueblos of Isleta and Acoma; he must not miss Cañon
Diablo when crossing that wonderful chasm on the wonderful
bridge, nor the gleam of the Lowell Observatory
at Flagstaff on its pine-clad hill-slope, nor fail to gaze on
the purple Franciscan peaks on which the lingering sunset
rays recall to him the poet's line,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Day in splendid purple dying."</p>

<p>Like a modern Telemachus he sees "the baths of all the
western stars."</p>

<p>Between La Junta in Colorado and Los Angeles in California
there lies a journey which, in connection with its
side trips, is unequalled, because there is only one Grand
Cañon, one Pike's Peak with its adjacent wonderland, and
because, as a rule, elsewhere in the United States&mdash;or in
the world, for that matter,&mdash;forests do not turn into
stone nor stars hurl themselves into the earth with a
force that buries them too deep for resurrection. Through
the East and the Middle West the mountains do not, on
general principles, attempt any competition with the clouds,
but content themselves with the gentle altitude of a mile
or so; the stars stay decorously in the firmament and are
not shooting madly about, trying fantastic Jules Verne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
experiments to determine whether or not they can shine
better from the centre of the earth than from their natural
place in the upper air; the stars of the Eastern skies
"stand pat," so to speak, and are not flying in the face
of the universe; so that, altogether, in these regions it
would seem quite evident that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"The world is built in order,</div>
<div class="verse">And the atoms march in tune."</div>
</div></div>

<p>These exceptional variations to the established order,
however,&mdash;these wonderful peaks and cañons and forests
and gardens of gods,&mdash;all these enchanted things lie, naturally,
within the Land of Enchantment, within this vast
territorial expanse replete with many other attractions.
From La Junta let the traveller journey into Colorado
with its splendor of resources, and in gazing upon the
stately, solemn impressiveness of the Snowy Range he
cannot but feel that Nature has predestined Colorado
for the theatre of noble life and realize the influence as
all-pervading. Infinite possibilities open before one as
an alluring vista, and he hears the refrain,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent1">"My spirit beats her mortal bars</div>
<div class="verse">As down dark tides the glory slides</div>
<div class="indent1">And star-like mingles with the stars."</div>
</div></div>

<p>With the excursions offered,&mdash;grand panoramas of
mountain views where the tourist from his lofty perch in
the observation-car looks down on clouds and on peaks
and pinnacles far below the heights to which his train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
climbs,&mdash;with the cogwheel road ascending Pike's Peak,
the fascinating drives through Cheyenne Cañon, the Garden
of the Gods, Ute Pass, and around Glen Eyrie, and with
the luxurious ease of life at "The Antlers," the traveller
finds fairly a new world, rich in suggestion and wide outlook.
This attractive region is, however, only one of the
central points of interest in Colorado. Denver, the brilliant
and fascinating capital; Pueblo, the metropolis of
Southern Colorado; Glenwood Springs, the romantic and
fashionable watering place and summer resort high up in the
mountains on the beautiful "scenic route" of the Denver
and Rio Grande; Boulder, the picturesque mountain town,
with its State University so ably conducted; Greeley, the
town of the "Union Colony," whose romantic and tragic
story is a part of the great history of the Centennial
State, and where an admirable normal school draws students
from all over the country, even including New England,&mdash;these
and a wealth of other features offer interest
that is coming to engage the attention of the civilized
world.</p>

<p>New Mexico has been more or less considered as one of
the impossible and uncivilized localities, or has failed to
establish any claim to being considered at all; yet here
is a territory whose climate is simply delightful by virtue
of its altitude,&mdash;cool in summer and mild and sunny in
winter,&mdash;whose mines of amethysts and other precious
stones suggest developments yet undreamed-of; whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
ethnological interest, in the marvellous remains of Cliff-dwellers
and of a people far antedating any authentic
records, enchains the scientist; a territory whose future
promises almost infinitely varied riches in many directions
of its development.</p>

<p>Arizona is simply a treasure land. If it offered only
that enthralling feature, the Grand Cañon, it would
be a central point of pilgrimage for the entire civilized
world; but even aside from this,&mdash;the sublimest vision
ever offered to human eye,&mdash;even aside from the Grand
Cañon, which dominates the world as the most sublime
spectacle,&mdash;Arizona offers the fascinations of the Painted
Desert, the Tonto Basin, the uncanny buttes that
loom up in grotesque shapes on the horizon, the
dreamy lines of mountain ranges, the strange pueblos,
the productive localities where grains and where fruits
and flowers grow with tropical luxuriance, the Petrified
Forests, and the exquisite coloring of sky and
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Southern California, with its brilliantly fascinating metropolis,
Los Angeles; the neighboring city of Pasadena,
the "Crown of the Valley"; with an extensive electric
trolley-car connection with towns within a radius of fifty
miles, and other distinctive and delightful features, almost
each one of which might well furnish a separate chapter of
description; with mountain trips made easy and enjoyable
by the swift electric lines,&mdash;all this region fascinates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
imagination and indicates new and wonderful vistas of life
in the immediate future. The vast and varied resources
of the great Southwest will also, as they are developed,
increasingly affect the economic aspects of the country.</p>

<p>To the traveller one fact stands out in especial prominence,
and that is that the traditional primitive conditions
in this region hardly continue to exist. The picturesque
aspects of nature form the stage setting to very-much-up-to-date
life. The opportunities and advantages already
offered and constantly increasing are greater than would
at first be considered possible. In isolated homes on the
desert the children of the family will be found studying
the higher mathematics, taking music lessons, or receiving
lessons in languages (classic, or the romance languages)
from some one in the neighborhood who is able to give
such instruction. If any traveller expects to encounter the
traditional "cow-boy" aspects of life, he will be very much
disappointed. There is no refinement of life in the East
that is not mirrored and duplicated in the West. There
are no aspirations, no ideals, no fine culture in the East
that have not their corresponding aspects in the great
West. In fact, in many ways the West begins where the
East leaves off. For instance, the new towns of the West
that have sprung up within the past twenty years have
never known what it was to have gas or horse-cars.
They begin with electric lights and electric transit. Their
schoolhouses are built with up-to-date methods, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
houses, however modest, are constructed with a taste and
a beauty unknown in the rural regions of the East. The
square white house with green blinds and a straight
stone-paved pathway to the front gate, so common in New
England, is not seen in the West. Instead, the most
modest little structure has its piazza, its projecting bay
window thrown out, its balcony&mdash;something, at all events,
tasteful and beautiful to the eye.</p>

<p>The journey from La Junta (in Colorado) to Los Angeles
offers a series of enthralling pictorial effects that are
invested with all the refinements of civilized life delightfully
devoid of its commonplaceness. These long transcontinental
trains with two engines, one at the front and
one at the rear, with their different grades of the Pullman,
the tourist, and the emigrant car service, are as distinctive
a feature of the twentieth century as the "prairie
schooners" were of the early half of the nineteenth century.
The real journey begins, of course, at Chicago,
and as these trains leave in the evening the traveller fares
forth in the seclusion of his berth in the Pullman. The
nights on a sleeping-car may be a very trance of ecstasy
to one who loves to watch the panorama of the skies.
Raise the curtain, pile up the pillows to the angle that
one can gaze without lifting the head, and what ethereal
visions one is wafted through! One has a sense of flying
in the air among the starry spaces, especially if he chances
to have the happy fortune of a couch on the side where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the moon is shining down,&mdash;a midsummer moon, with
stars, and filmy, flitting clouds,&mdash;when the panorama of
the air becomes the enchantment of a dream.</p>

<p>It is, literally, "such stuff as dreams are made of," and
when one drops off into slumber, he utilizes it for his
fancies of the night. Miss Harriet Hosmer, the famous
sculptor, once related a story of a night journey she took
with a party of congenial spirits on horseback between
Rome and Florence. By way of "a lark" they rested by
day and rode by night, and the beauty of the effects of
light and shade sank into her mind so that she drew
on them thirty years or more later for the wonderful
designs in her great "Gates," which even rival those
of Ghiberti. "The night hath counsel" and suggestion
of artistic beauty as well, and the effects that one may get
from a flying train are impossible to obtain under any
other condition. After all, is it not a part of the fine
art of living to take the enjoyment of the moment as it
comes, in whatever guise, without lamenting that it is not
something else?</p>

<p>These splendidly equipped trains of the Santa Fé service
admit very little dust; the swift motion keeps up a
constant breeze, and some necromancy of perpetual vigilance
surrounds the traveller with exceptional cleanliness
and personal comfort. One experiences a certain sense of
detachment from ordinary day and daylight duties that
is exhilarating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Kansas City, the gateway to the great Southwest,
might well claim attention as an important manufacturing
and distributing centre; Kansas itself, once the bed of an
inland sea, is not without scientific interest for the deposits
of gypsum and salt that have left the soil so fertile, as well
as for strange fossils revealing gigantic animals, both
land and aquatic, that have lived there,&mdash;the mastodon,
rhinoceros, elephant, the crocodile and shark,&mdash;many
of whose skeletons are preserved in the National
Museum in Washington. The prosperous inland
cities with their schools and colleges, their beautiful
homes and constant traffic,&mdash;all these features of Kansas,
the state of heroic history, are deeply impressive. But
it is Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, with which
these pages are chiefly concerned, and the especially
picturesque aspects of the journey begin with La
Junta.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p013.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ACOMA. TWO MILES DISTANT</p>

<p>Entering Colorado, the plateau is four thousand feet
above sea level, and constantly rising. This altitude renders
the climate of New Mexico particularly invigorating
and delightful.</p>

<p>The most romantic and poetically enchanting regions of
the United States are entered into on this journey, in
which easy detours allow one to visit that mysterious
"City in the Sky," the pueblo of Acoma, near Albuquerque
in New Mexico; to make excursions to Montezuma's
Well; to the mysterious ruin of Casa Grande; to the Twin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Lakes (which lie on a mountain crest); and to study
other marvels of nature in Arizona. The splendors of
Colorado, with the myriad mountain peaks and silver lakes,
the mysterious cañons and deep gorges, the rose-flushed
valleys lying fair under a sapphire sky in the
luminous golden atmosphere, and the profound interest inspired
in the general social tone of life in its educational,
economic, and religious aspects, invest a summer-day tour
through the Land of Enchantment with all the glory and
the freshness of a dream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Denver</span> the Beautiful is the dynamo of Western civilization,
and the keynote to the entire scale of life in Colorado.
The atmosphere seems charged with high destiny.
"I worship with wonder the great Fortune," said Emerson,
using the term in the universal sense, "and find it none
too large for use. My receptivity matches its greatness."
The receptivity of the dwellers in this splendid environment
seems to match its greatness, and expand with the
increase of its vast resources. As Paris is France, so
Denver is Colorado. Hardly any other commonwealth
and its capital are in such close relation, unless it be that
of Massachusetts and Boston. Colorado is a second Italy,
rather than Switzerland, as it has been called. Over it
bends the Italian sky; its luminous atmosphere is that
of Dante's country; at night the stars hang low as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
hang over the heights of San Miniato in fair Florence;
the mountain coloring, when one has distance enough,
has the soft melting purple and amethyst lights of the
Apennines, and the courtesy of the people is not less
marked than in the land of the olive and the myrtle.
Then, too, the light&mdash;the resplendent and luminous effect
of the atmosphere&mdash;is like that of no other state.
The East is dark by comparison with this transparency
of golden light.</p>

<p>As the metropolis of the great West between Chicago
and the Pacific Coast, Denver has a continual procession
of visitors from all countries, who pause in the overland
journey to study the outlook of the most wonderful state
in the Union,&mdash;that of the richest and most varied resources.
To find within the limits of one state resources
that include gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, coal, and tin
mines; agriculture, horticulture, stock raising, manufactures,
and oil wells, sounds like a fiction; yet this is literally
true. Add to these some of the most beautiful
and sublime scenery in the world, the best modern appliances,
and the most intelligent and finely aspiring class
of people, and one has an outline of the possibilities of
the Centennial State.</p>

<p>Denver is, geographically, the central city of the country,
equally accessible from both the Atlantic and the Pacific
coasts, from the North and the South. It has the finest
climate of the continent; its winters are all sunshine and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
exhilaration, with few cloudy or stormy days; its summers
are those in which oppressive heat is hardly known, and
the nights are invariably cool. It is a great railroad
centre; it has infinite space in which to extend itself
in any direction; it has unsurpassed beauty of location.
No city west of Chicago concentrates so many desirable
features, for all this wealth of resource and loveliness of
scenic setting is the theatre of noble energy and high
achievement. Denver is only twenty-six hours from
Chicago; it is but forty-five hours from New York.
Although apparently a city of the plains, it is a mile
above sea level, and is surrounded with more than two
hundred miles of mountain ranges, whose changeful color,
in royal purple, deep rose, amber, pale blue, gleams
through the transparent air against the horizon. The
business and hotel part of Denver lies on a lower level,
while the Capitol, a superb building of Colorado marble,
and all the best residential region, is on a higher plateau.
The Capitol has the novel decoration of an electric flag,
so arranged that through colored glass of red, white, and
blue the intense light shines.</p>

<p>The Denver residential region is something unusual
within general municipal possibilities, as it has unbounded
territory over which to expand, thus permitting each home
to have its own grounds, nearly all of which are spacious;
and these, with the broad streets lined with trees, give
to this part of the city the appearance of an enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
park. For miles these avenues and streets extend, all
traversed by swift electric cars that so annihilate time and
space that a man may live five, ten, or a dozen miles from
his place of business and call it all joy. He insures
himself pure air, beautiful views, and an abundance of
ground. If the family desires to go into the city for
evening lectures, concerts, or the theatre, the transit is
swift and enjoyable. They control every convenience.
These individual villas are all fire-proof. The municipal
law requires the buildings to be of brick or stone, thus
making Denver a practically fireproof city. Both the
business blocks and the homes share the benefit of the
improved modern taste in architecture. The city of
Denver covers an area of eighty-nine square miles, and
these limits are soon to be extended.</p>

<p>The Capitol has an enchanting mountain view; it also
contains a fine museum of historic relics found in Colorado
from cliff-dwellings and other points. A million dollars
has been offered&mdash;and refused&mdash;for this state collection.
The City Park, covering nearly four hundred acres, with
its two lakes, its beds of flowers and groups of shrubbery;
its casino, where an orchestra plays every afternoon in the
summer, while dozens of carriages and motor cars with
their tastefully dressed occupants draw up and listen to
the music, is a centre of attraction to both residents and
visitors. This park is to Denver as is the Pincian Hill to
Rome, or as Hyde Park to London,&mdash;the fashionable drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and rendezvous. Great beds of scarlet geraniums contrast
with the emerald green of the grass, while here and there
a fountain throws its spray into the air. Far away on
the horizon are the encircling mountains in view for over
two hundred miles, the ranges taking on all the colors of
fairyland, while a deep turquoise sky, soft and beautiful,
bends over the entire panorama. From this plateau four
great peaks are in view: Pike's Peak, seventy-five miles to
the south; Long's, Gray's, and James's peaks, all distinctly
silhouetted against the sky, rising from the serrated range
which connects them. During these open-air concerts
in the park there is a midsummer holiday air over the
scene as if all the city were <i>en fête</i>.</p>

<p>The architectural scheme of Denver's residential region
harmonizes with the landscape. The houses are not the
palaces of upper Fifth Avenue and Riverside drive, or of
Massachusetts or Connecticut avenues in Washington;
but there is hardly an individual residence that has not
legitimate claim to beauty. The tower, the oriel window,
and the broad balcony are much in evidence; and
the piazza, with its swinging seat, its easy chairs, and
table disposed on a bright rug, suggest a charm of <i>vie intime</i>
that appeals to the passer-by. Books, papers, and
magazines are scattered over the table: the home has the
unmistakable air of being lived in and enjoyed; of being
the centre of a happy, intelligent life, buoyant with enterprise
and energy, and identified with the social progress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the day. On the greenest of lawn a jet of water or, in
many cases, a fountain plays, the advantage of an irrigated
country being that the householder creates and controls
his own climatic conditions. The rain,&mdash;it raineth
every day when irrigation determines the shower; roses
grow in riotous profusion on the lawn, and the crimson
"rambler" climbs the portico; lilies nod in the luminous
gold of the sunshine, and all kinds of foliage plants lend
their rich color to these beautiful grounds that surround
every home. To the children growing up in Denver the
spectacle of dreary streets would be as much of a novelty
as the ruins of Karnak. The line that divides the past
from the present is not only very definite, but also very
recent, as is indicated by the question of a five-year-old
lad who wonderingly asked: "Mamma, did they ever
have horses draw the trolley cars?" The mastodon is
not more remote in antiquity to the man or woman of
to-day than was the idea of horses drawing a car to this
child. Between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries
the gulf of demarcation is almost as wide as between
the fifteenth and the nineteenth.</p>

<p>The streets of Denver are very broad, usually planted
with trees, and the smooth roads offer an earthly paradise
to the motor-car transit that abounds in Denver. One
of the happy excursions is that of motoring to Colorado
Springs, seventy-five miles distant, a constant entertainment.
With the splendid electric-transit system, annihilating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
distance; with the broad streets paved after the
best modern methods; with the wide and smooth sidewalks
of Colorado stone and the almost celestial charm
of the view, city life is transformed. Telephonic service
is practically universal; electric lighting and an admirable
water system are among the easy conveniences of this section,
which is not yet suburban because of its complete
identification with all other parts of the city.</p>

<p>The universality of telephonic intercourse in Colorado
would go far to support the theory of Dr. Edward Everett
Hale that the time will come when writing will be a lost
art, and will be considered, at best, as a clumsy and laborious
means of communication in much the same
manner that the late centuries regard the production of
the manuscript book before the invention of the art of
printing. In few cities is the telephone service carried
out to such constant colloquial use as in Denver. The
traveller finds in his room a telephone as a matter of
course, and there are very few quarters of an hour when
the bell does not summon him to chat with a friend,
from one on the same floor of the hotel to one who is
miles away in the city, or even fifty or a hundred miles
distant, as at Greeley, Colorado Springs, or Pueblo.</p>

<p>"How are you to-day?" questions the friendly voice.
"Did you see so-and-so in the morning papers? And
what do you think about it? and can you be ready at
eleven to go to hear Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; lecture? and at one will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
you lunch with Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;? the entire conversation to be
in Italian? and could you go at about four this afternoon
to a tea to meet an Oriental Princess who will discuss
the laws of reincarnation? and will you also dine with
us at seven, and go later to the Woman's Municipal
Club that holds a conference to-night?" All those lovely
things fall upon one with apparently no thought of its
being an unusual day&mdash;this is Denver! This is twentieth-century
life. This is an illustration of what can be
done when the non-essential is eliminated from the days
and that which is essential is felicitously pursued.</p>

<p>When the Denver woman remarked to the Eastern
woman sojourner within the gates that she was unable to
be away that autumn on any extended absence, as the
campaign was to be more than usually important, the
wanderer from the Atlantic shore irreverently laughed.
Her hostess endeavored (unsuccessfully) not to seem
shocked by this levity regarding serious subjects. She remembered
that there were extenuating circumstances, and
that the Eastern women had really never had a fair chance
in life. Their part, she reflected, consisted in obeying laws
and abiding by whatever was decreed, with no voice allowed
to express their own preferences or convictions. She
remembered that a proportion of the feminine New England
intellect consecrates its powers and its time to extended
researches in the Boston Public Library and in the venerable
records of the Massachusetts Historical Society, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
a perpetual quest of information regarding its ancestors,
who are worshipped with the zeal and fervor of the
Japanese. The Boston woman, indeed, may have only the
most vague ideas regarding the rate bill, the problem of
the Philippines, the Panama Canal, or the next Governor
of Massachusetts; but she is thoroughly conversant with
all the details of the Mayflower and her own ancestral
dignities. Recognizing the New England passion for its
ancestry, a leading Boston journal offers a page, weekly,
to open correspondence on the momentous question as to
whether Winthrop Bellingham married Priscilla Patience
Mather in 1699 or in 1700, and a multitude of similar
questions concerning the vanished centuries. The Denver
woman realized all this and was discreetly charitable in
her judgment of her friend's failure to recognize the significant
side of the political enfranchisement of women in
Colorado. For despite some actual disadvantages and
defects of woman suffrage in the centennial state, and a
vast amount of exaggerated criticism on these defects, it is
yet a benefit to the four states that enjoy it,&mdash;Colorado,
Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming.</p>

<p>In a majority of the states of the entire nation there
is a conviction (and one not without its claims) that
women are adequately represented and protected in all
their rights, as things are, and that it is superfluous to
increase the vote.</p>

<p>The anti-suffrage argument suggests many reflections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
whose truth must be admitted, and this side of the controversy
is espoused and led by some proportion of men
and women whose names inspire profound respect, if not
conviction, with their belief. Still, the fact remains that
when woman suffrage is subjected to the practical test of
experience, the advantages are so obvious, its efficacy for
good so momentous, that their realization fairly compels acceptance.
In the entire nation there has never been a man
or a woman whose clearness and profundity of intellect,
moral greatness, and sympathetic insight into the very
springs of national and individual life exceeded those of Lucy
Stone, the remarkable pioneer in the political emancipation
of women, whose logical eloquence and winning, beautiful
personality was the early focus of this movement. Mrs.
Stone surrounded herself with a noble group,&mdash;Mary A.
Livermore, Julia Ward Howe, Thomas Wentworth Higginson,
and others whose names readily suggest themselves,
and with whom, in the complete companionship
and sympathy of her husband, Dr. Henry B. Blackwell,
she successfully worked, even though the final success has
not yet been achieved. Other great and noble women&mdash;Susan
B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton&mdash;consecrated
their entire lives and remarkable powers to the early
championship of woman suffrage. The present ranks of
women workers&mdash;the younger women&mdash;are so numerous,
and they include so large a proportion of the most notable
women of both the East and the West, that volumes would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
not afford sufficient room for adequate allusion. In Denver
the leading people are fully convinced of the responsibility
of women in politics. Although the ballot has
not been generally granted to women, the very movement
toward it has resulted in their higher education and their
larger freedom in all ways. The situation reminds one of
the "subtle ways" of Emerson's Brahma:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"If the red slayer think he slays,</div>
<div class="indent1">Or if the slain think he is slain,</div>
<div class="verse">They know not well the subtle ways</div>
<div class="indent1">I keep, and pass, and turn again.</div>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"Far or forgot to me is near;</div>
<div class="indent1">Shadow and sunlight are the same;</div>
<div class="verse">The vanished gods to me appear;</div>
<div class="indent1">And one to me are shame and fame.</div>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="indent1">"They reckon ill who leave me out;</div>

<div class="indent1">I am the doubter and the doubt,</div>
<div class="verse">And I the hymn the Brahmin sings."</div>
</div>
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><hr class="tb" />
</div></div></div>

<p>Apparently, the principle of woman suffrage has "subtle
ways" in which "to pass and turn again." It has
recently turned in a manner to compel a new and more
profound revision of all opinion and argument.</p>

<p>Colorado presents a most interesting field for the study
of woman suffrage, and from any fair and adequate review
of its workings and results there could hardly fail to be
but one conclusion,&mdash;that of its signal value and importance
as a factor in human progress. One of its special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
claims is of a nature not down on the bills,&mdash;the fact of the
great intellectual enlargement and stimulus,&mdash;aside from
its results, which the very exercise of political power gives
to the women of the state. It is seen in the higher quality
of conversational tone and the tendency to eliminate
the inconsequential and the inane because great matters
of universal interest were thus brought home to women
in connection with their power to decide on these matters.
This result is perhaps equally seen among the
women who rejoice and the women who regret the fact of
their political enfranchisement. For in Colorado, as well
as in other states, there is a proportion of women who do
not believe in the desirability of the ballot for themselves.
They sincerely regret that it has been "forced," as they
say, upon them. This proportion in Colorado is not
a large one, but it includes some of the most intelligent
and cultured women, just as an enthusiastic acceptance
of the ballot includes a much larger proportion of
this higher order of women. However, welcome or unwelcome,
desired or not desired, the ballot is there, and
so the women who regret this fact yet realize its responsibility
and feel it a moral duty to use it wisely as well.
And so they, too, study great questions, and discuss them,
and fit themselves to use the power that is conferred upon
them. All this reacts on the general tone of society, and
the quality of conversation at ladies' lunches, at teas,
and at clubs, is of a far higher order than is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
found in other states among the more purely feminine
gatherings.</p>

<p>Among the women who have successfully administered
public office in Colorado was the late Mrs.
Helen Grenfell, whose record as State Superintendent
of Public Instruction was so remarkable that both
political parties supported her. A Denver journal said
of her:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mrs. Grenfell's term has lasted six years, the last two
years having been under a Republican administration, although
Mrs. Grenfell is a Democrat. Her most notable
achievement has been in her conduct of the school lands of
the state, making them valuable sources of revenue. Her
policy from the first was against the sale of the school lands,
which comprise some three million acres. The income from
such sales had been limited, as the investments were prescribed,
and the interest rate rather low, as Western interest
goes. The leasing system was inaugurated under Mrs. Grenfell's
direction, and the result was an increase of school revenues
of nearly two hundred thousand dollars a year, with no
decrease in the capital. The Land Department of the state
shares the credit with the state superintendent of public
instruction, as they have administered her policy wisely, but
the policy was hers alone."</p></blockquote>

<p>Judge Lindsay of Denver, giving an official opinion as
to the desirability of woman suffrage for Colorado, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Woman suffrage in Colorado for over ten years has more
than demonstrated its justice. No one would dare to propose
its repeal; and, if left to the men of the state, any proposition
to revoke the right bestowed upon women would be
overwhelmingly defeated.</p>

<p>"Many good laws have been obtained in Colorado which
would not have been secured but for the power and influence
of women.</p>

<p>"At some of the elections in Denver frauds have been
committed. Ninety-nine per cent of these frauds were committed
by men, without any connivance or assistance, direct
or indirect, from women; but because one per cent were
committed by women, there are ignorant or careless-minded
people in other states who actually argue that this is a reason
for denying women the right to vote. If it were a just reason
for denying suffrage to women, it would be a ten times greater
reason for denying it to men.</p>

<p>"In Colorado it has never made women any the less womanly
or any the less motherly, or interfered with their
duties in the home, that they have been given the right to
participate in the affairs of state.</p>

<p>"Many a time I have heard the 'boss' in the political
caucus object to the nomination of some candidate because of
his bad moral character, with the mere explanation that if the
women found him out it might hurt the whole ticket. While
many bad men have been nominated and elected to office in
spite of woman suffrage, they have not been nominated and
elected because of woman suffrage. If the women alone had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
a right to vote, it would result in a class of men in public
office whose character for morality, honesty, and courage
would be of a much higher order....</p>

<p>"People have no right to judge woman suffrage in Colorado
by the election frauds in a few precincts. The election frauds
in Philadelphia, where women do not vote, were never used
as a reason why suffrage should be denied to men....</p>

<p>"With women, as with men, it requires more or less public
sentiment to arouse them to their civic duties; but when
aroused, as they frequently are, their power for good cannot
be overestimated. Again, the very fact that the women have
such a power is a wonderful reserve force in the cause of
righteousness in Colorado, and has been a powerful deterrent
in anticipating and opposing the forces of evil.</p>

<p>"It does not take any mother from her home duties or cares
to spend ten minutes in going to the polling place and casting
her vote and returning to the bosom of her home; but
in that ten minutes she wields a power that is doing more to
protect that home now, and will do more to protect it in the
future, and to protect all other homes, than any power or
influence in Colorado.</p>

<p>"I know that the great majority of people in Colorado favor
woman suffrage, after more than a decade of practical experience,&mdash;first,
because it is fair, just, and decent; and secondly,
because its influence has been good rather than evil in our
political affairs."</p></blockquote>

<p>Judge Lindsay's words represent the general attitude of
the representative people of the state.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>The Hon. Henry M. Teller, senior senator of Colorado,
is one of the most interesting men in the Centennial State,
and the traveller who may meet and talk with him is impressed
with his quiet sincerity, with the sense of reserved
power with which he seems endowed, and the refinement
and directness of his methods. He is by birth an Eastern
man, and a graduate of Harvard; but his mature life has
been passed in Colorado. As a lawyer his law office claims
much of his time and thought, even with all the great
tide of national interests with which he is identified. He
is a thorough and, indeed, an astute politician; not
in the "machine" sense, but with a very clear and comprehensive
grasp of the situation and a large infusion
of practical sagacity. Senator Teller is in no sense an
enthusiast. He is responsive to high aims and high
ideals; he knows what they are, so to speak; he recognizes
them on sight; he never falls into the error of under-valuing
them; but he is not a man to be carried away by
an ecstatic vision, and he would have no use for wings at
all where he had feet. He would regard the solid earth
as a better foundation, on the whole, than the air, and one
more suited to existing conditions.</p>

<p>Senator Teller has had more than a quarter of a century's
experience in political life and in statesmanship.
For two years he was a member of the Cabinet. For
twenty-seven years he has been in the Senate, where, with
Senator Hoar of Massachusetts, he shared the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
honor, and the most absolute confidence, in both his flawless
integrity and conspicuous ability, that the Senate, and
the nation as well, can give to him.</p>

<p>Senator Patterson, the junior senator from Colorado, is
a man whom, if he encounters an obstacle does not grant
it the dignity of recognition. He instantly discovers the
end,&mdash;the desired result,&mdash;and declares, per saltum, "It
is right; it should be done,&mdash;it shall be done." Senator
Patterson is a man of very keen perceptions and one with
whom it is easy to come into touch instantly; he is responsive,
sympathetic, full of faith that the thing that ought
to be accomplished can be accomplished, and therefore that
it shall be. Senator Patterson has the typical American
experience of successful men lying behind him. He was
on familiar terms with the intricacies of a newspaper office
in his youth; he studied in an Indiana college without
an annual expenditure of that twenty thousand dollars
which some of the latter-day Harvard undergraduates find
indispensable to the process of securing their "B. A.," and
tradition records, indeed, that the junior Colorado senator,
in the prehistoric days of his youth, set out for the fountain
of learning with a capital of forty dollars; that he
frugally walked from Crawfordsville to Indianapolis that
he might not deplete his financial estate which was destined
to buy a scholarship, and that in this unrecorded
tour in the too, too truly rural region of his early life, he
cleaned two clocks on the way in payment for lodging, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
that he cleaned them uncommonly well. Of all this traditionary
history who shall say? Senator Patterson is a
man who would always keep faith with his aims and convictions.
He is sunny and full of wit, and full of faith
in the ultimate triumph of good things in general, and is,
all in all, one of the most genial and delightful of men&mdash;and
senators.</p>

<p>It is related that Senator Patterson first dawned upon
Denver in its primeval period of 1872, when its municipal
affairs were conducted by two prominent&mdash;if not eminent&mdash;gentlemen,
one of whom was the champion gambler,
and the other the champion brewer of the metropolis.
There were eleven thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight
other citizens in this municipality besides the brewer and
the gambler (and the population was said to have been
twelve thousand in all), and the eleven thousand nine hundred
and ninety-eight, like "The Ten" of early Florentine
history, decided that would "reform the town." Their
united effort was to elect Mr. Patterson as Mayor. And
a good one he proved; and he has gone on and on, in the
minds as well as in the hearts of his fellow-citizens, until
now he is the colleague of Senator Teller, and he offers
another typical illustration of true American integrity
and honorable ambition and success. Personally, Senator
Patterson is one of the most winning men in the world,
and one delights in his success and the high estimation
in which he is held.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>The development of Colorado and other parts of the
great Southwest during the past half-century has created
a new order of employment in that of the government
expert,&mdash;the specialist in upland or hydraulic irrigation,
in engineering and mining problems. The government
surveying work has also increased largely, both in extent
and in the greater number of specialties now required.
The Geological Survey and the Agricultural Department,
both included under the Department of the Interior, are
rapidly multiplying branches of work that require both the
skilled training and ability for original research and accomplishment.
These positions, which command government
salaries at from some eighteen to twenty-five hundred
dollars a year, afford such opportunity for the expert to
reveal his value that private corporations and business
houses continually draw on the ranks of the government
employees. Of late years the demand for the expert irrigation
engineer has been so great in Colorado as to seriously
embarrass the government forces by drawing some of the
best men for private service. Denver is an especial centre
for these enterprises, as being the natural metropolis
for the vast inter-mountain region and the plains country
of the Missouri River. This vast territory will
support many millions more of population. In fact,
the dwellers within this described territory at this day
are but pioneers on the frontier to what the future
will develop, although they already enjoy all the benefits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of the older states, with countless advantages beside
which they cannot enjoy.</p>

<p>The smelteries in Denver, of which the Grant is the
largest, treat millions of pounds of copper and lead, and
great quantities of silver and gold, while there are also
extensive ones in Pueblo, Leadville, Durango, and other
places. There is also a good proportion of Colorado ore
which is not treated at all at smelteries, but is of a free-milling
order. The revenue from mining has exceeded
fifty millions of dollars annually of late years, but the
revenue from agriculture exceeds that of the mines, and to
these must be added some twenty millions a year from live
stock during the past two or three years. In the aggregate,
Colorado has an internal revenue of hardly less than
one hundred millions a year, and this largely passes through
Denver as the distributing point, constituting the Capital
one of the most prosperous of young cities. Denver stands
alone in a rich region. One thousand miles from Chicago,
six hundred miles from Kansas City, and four hundred
miles from Salt Lake City, Denver holds its place without
any rival.</p>

<p>The ideal conditions of living have never been entirely
combined in any one locality on this sublunary planet, so
far as human history reveals; and with all the scenic
charm, the rich and varied resources, and the phenomenal
development of Colorado, no one could truthfully describe
it as Utopia. There is no royal road to high achievement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
in any line. Difficulties and obstacles are "a part of the
play," and he alone is wise who, by his own determination,
faith, and persistence of energy, transforms his very
obstacles into stepping-stones and thus gains the strength
of that which he overcomes.</p>

<p>Northern Colorado has great resources even beyond the
coal fields that will make it the power centre; with its
prestige of Denver, and such surrounding towns as Greeley,
Boulder, Fort Collins, Golden, and others, all of which
fall within a group of social and commercial centres that
will soon be interconnected by a network of electric trolley
lines. For the electric road between Greeley and Denver
Mr. J. D. Houseman has secured a right of way one hundred
and fifty feet wide, the rails being midway between
the Union Pacific and the Burlington lines. Mr. Houseman
is one of the noted financiers of the East who came
to Denver to incorporate and build this road, and his is
only one of three companies that are now in consultation
with the power company negotiating for the supplies which
will enable them to build the proposed new roads.</p>

<p>The Seeman Tunnel, which is to be constructed near
Idaho Springs, at a distance of fifty miles from Denver,
and which is to be twelve miles in length, although at
an elevation of eighty-five hundred feet, is yet to extend
under Fall River and the Yankee, Alice, and the Lombard
mining districts. It will be one of the marvels of the
state, and will penetrate a thousand mining veins. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Continental Mines, Power and Reduction Company, recently
incorporated with a capital of three millions, of
which Captain Seeman is the president, owns many of the
mining veins which will be touched by this tunnel. Many
of the veins to which this tunnel will afford approach have
not been accessible heretofore for more than four or five
months in the year. For the remaining six or seven
months travel is practically impossible in these mountains;
the "claims" cannot be reached, as they lie in the region
of perpetual snow. When the Seeman Tunnel is completed
the owner of any claim that is tapped by it can, by paying
a certain royalty per ton for each ton of ore mined, obtain
the right to work it in the tunnel, thus being able to proceed
through the entire year and at a far less cost in
production than at present. Regarding this gigantic enterprise,
Captain Seeman said, in June of 1906, that the
work would be pushed as rapidly as men, money, and
machinery could advance it, and, he added: "I consider
it one of the greatest tunnels ever attempted, and one
that will hold the record for mining tunnels. I am
confident that we will strike enough ore within the first
two or three miles to keep us busy for years." The
Leviathan is one of the first veins that the tunnel is
expected to tap,&mdash;a vein three hundred feet wide on the
surface,&mdash;and while already traced for more than three
miles, it holds every promise for as yet uncalculated
extension. The Lombard is another vein of leading importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
which promises to be a bonanza. Gold is the
principal mineral that appears in these veins, although
silver, lead, and copper are found. Another ore, tungsten,
used for hardening in armor plates, large guns,
and the best mechanical implements,&mdash;an ore valued at
six hundred dollars per ton,&mdash;has been discovered in
these veins. The Seeman Tunnel is located directly under
James's Peak.</p>

<p>Another of the remarkable engineering marvels that
mark the progress of Colorado is the Moffat road, the
new railroad between Denver and Salt Lake City, now
open as far as Kremling, which initiated its passenger
service in the late June of 1906 with daily excursions, in
solid vestibuled trains, making the round trip between
Denver and Tolland, Corona (the region of perpetual snow)
and Arrow, on the Pacific slope of the Continental Divide,
in one day. This vast enterprise is due to the genius and
the prophetic vision of President David H. Moffat of the
First National Bank in Denver, one of the leaders in all
that makes for the best interests and the advancement of
the Centennial State, and of the future of Denver the
Beautiful. Mr. Moffat says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Denver's population is growing steadily and naturally.
Some time ago I made the prediction that Denver would have
three hundred thousand inhabitants within five years. I see
no reason for changing my estimate. Rather, I might increase
it, but I will be conservative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>"The things that build up a city's wealth and population
are 'round about Denver in prodigal quantities. If Denver
had only the state of Colorado from which to draw, her future
would be absolutely assured. But consider the vast territory
that is tributary to this city. It stretches away to the east,
west, north, and south, an area quite one-third of the whole
country, and quite the richest in all natural resources. Denver
is the geographical hub of this territory."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Moffat road will climb the ramparts formed by the
main range of the Rocky Mountains west of Denver and
run directly westward, passing through one of the most
fertile sections of the state. The road ascends to an
altitude of eleven thousand six hundred feet, running
through a region rich in minerals, and especially in coal.
The sublime scenery along the route has already made it
most popular for excursions, which draw a vast tourist
travel continually. President Moffat's road has brought
Routt County into such prominence that investors
from the East are being attracted to this region, a
notable one among these being the Eastern capitalist,
C. B. Knox, who proposes to invest in copper, coal,
and iron in Routt County, which he regards as the
richest section in Colorado. Mr. Knox engaged the
services of several experts to examine and report to him
upon this region. To a press correspondent who inquired
of Mr. Knox his views regarding Colorado,
he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I believe that there is wealth unmeasured in Routt
County, and I am out here to put some money in there.
I am sure that this section of the state is one of the richest
territories in the country. How I became interested is a long
story,&mdash;too long to tell. But it is sufficient to say that I have
heard of Routt County for so long, and from so many different
people in whose judgment I have the utmost faith, that I have
come out here to invest some money. I believe thoroughly
that money put into Routt County will within a few years
bring handsome returns. If I did not believe that I should
not be here looking for a place in which to invest money.</p>

<p>"I have been to Steamboat Springs myself, and I am thoroughly
of the opinion that it is going to be one of the big
towns of your state. The fact is, I have never seen a better
looking proposition in my life than investing money in Routt
County. Already I have purchased some land, and I am going
to get more. It is this iron proposition that I am having
investigated the most completely. The iron to be found in
Routt County looks awfully good to me, and there is no
question in my mind that Routt County is the place to put
capital.</p>

<p>"I cannot, of course, at this time say just what properties
I have in view,&mdash;that would not be good business; but I have
under investigation locations of mineral property near Steamboat
and north and south of there. I have decided on nothing
definite; that is, as to just what ores I will endeavor to
exploit, for the whole proposition looks so good to me that I
am going to purchase probably several different kinds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
propositions. As I say, though, I am most interested in the
iron ore, as that seems to present the greatest opportunities."</p></blockquote>

<p>These views are significant not only as those of an
experienced financier who has unbounded faith in the
future of Colorado, but also as typical of the wide range
of vision which is open to the trained eye of the capitalist
and the organizer of great enterprises. The spellbinder
may work his will in Colorado. It is the land of infinite
opportunity. It offers resources totally unsurpassed in the
entire world for unlimited development, and these resources
await the recognition of those whose vision is sufficiently
true to discern the psychological moment.</p>

<p>The first railroad reached Denver thirty-six years ago,
and the city has now sixteen railroad lines. It has a
population of over two hundred and twenty-five thousand.
It is a geographical centre, which assures its permanent
importance as a distributing point. With two hundred
and twenty-five miles of street railway, with seventy-five
miles of paved streets, and a taxable property estimated
at one hundred and two and a third millions, Denver
holds unquestionable commercial importance.</p>

<p>When, on the evening of July Fourth, 1906, the splendid
electric flag, with the national colors intensified a thousand
fold in brilliancy by the electrical lights, floated in the
air from the dome of the Capitol on its commanding
eminence, and the new city Arch, a veritable <i>Arc de Triomphe</i>,
flashed its "Welcome" in electrical light to eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
throngs, the moment was one which might well have been
fixed on the sensitive plate of the camera of the future as
typical of the entire horoscope of Denver the Beautiful.
On that day had been unveiled this triumphal arch,
placed at the Seventeenth Street entrance to the city
from the Union Depot, which, in its sixteen hundred
electric lights, flashes its legend upon the vision of every
one entering Denver. This arch, weighing seventy tons,
eighty feet in length, and with a central height of fifty-nine
feet, is constructed from a combination of metals
so united as to give the best results in strength, durability,
and beauty, and thus to stand as a symbol of the
composite life of the nation. Over the entire surface has
been placed a plating of bronze finished with <i>verde antique</i>,
to thus give it the aspect of ancient bronze. It is
built at a cost of twenty-two thousand dollars, and the
originator of the idea, Mr. William Maher of Denver, received
the entire subscriptions for it within one day. The
design is that of a Denver girl, Miss Marie Woodson,
whose name must always be immortalized in connection
with this beautiful achievement which typifies the spirit
of the city. Constructed by one of the city manufactories,
the design and the execution are thus exclusively
of Denver. In his address at the unveiling of the arch,
Chancellor Buchtel said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To all men who stand for honesty, for industry, for justice,
for reverence for law, for reverence for life, for education,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
for self-reliance, for individual initiative, for independence, and
for sound character, the city of Denver speaks only one word,
and the state of Colorado speaks only one word, and that
word we have emblazoned on this glorious Arch,&mdash;the word
'Welcome.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Dean Hart, offering the Invocation, referred to the
scriptural fact that God had instructed his leaders to
build monuments that they might bear witness to some
act or covenant, and it was right that the people of
Denver should raise this similar monument to their
ideals of peace and happiness and truth and justice.
Mayor Speer, accepting the gift on behalf of the city,
emphasized the fact that the arch was to stand in its
place for ages as the expression of the attitude of the
citizens to the strangers who enter their gates. "It is
intended to reflect our hospitality," said Mayor Speer,
"on a traveller's arrival and on his departure. It is more
than a thing of beauty; it is the type of the new spirit
in Denver, an awakening of civic pride that is sure to be
followed by much that is artistic and beautiful in our
beloved city."</p>

<p>The spirit of Denver the Beautiful is finely interpreted
in these words by representative citizens. It is the spirit
of generous and cordial hospitality to all who are prepared
to enter into and to contribute to its high standards
of life. It is the spirit of continually forging ahead
to accomplish things; of that irresistible energy, combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
with the eternal vigilance, which is not only the
price of liberty, but the price of almost everything worth
having. With this zeal for the great achievements,&mdash;carrying
railroads through the mountains, opening the
inexhaustible treasures of mines, bringing the snow of
mountain peaks to irrigate the arid plains, establishing
electric transit for fifty miles about, and telephonic connection
that brings an area of hundreds of miles into
instant speaking range with Denver,&mdash;with all the zeal
for these executive accomplishments, the spirit of Denver
is focussed on that social progress which is aided and
fostered by all modern mechanical facilities. Education,
culture, and religion are nowhere more held as the essentials
of social progress than in Denver. Something of the
nature of the problems of civilization that confronted
the early pathfinders in Colorado may be inferred from
the words of Major Long,&mdash;whose name is now perpetuated
by the mountain peak that bears it,&mdash;when, in
1862, he stated, in an official report to the government:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This region, according to the best intelligence that can
be had, is thoroughly uninhabitable by a people depending on
agriculture for their subsistence, but, viewed as a frontier,
may prove of infinite importance to the United States, inasmuch
as it is calculated to serve as a barrier to prevent too
great an extension of our population westward and secure us
against the machinations or incursions of an enemy that
might otherwise be disposed to annoy us in that quarter."</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>Less than sixty-five years have passed since the region
of which Denver is the great centre was thus pronounced
useless except as a frontier to serve as protection from an
enemy, and this judgment reminds one of a keen insight
into the evolutionary progress of life expressed by Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe when she remarked that "Every generation
makes a fool of the one that went before it."
Colorado, pronounced "thoroughly uninhabitable" in
1842, was organized as a territory in 1861 and in 1876
admitted as a state.</p>

<p>Darwin, who regarded "climate and the affections" as
the only absolute necessities of terrestrial existence,
should have lived in Denver, for of all the beautiful climates
is that in which revels the capital of Colorado. The
air is all liquid gold from sunrise till sunset; the mountains
swim in a sea of azure blue; the ground is bare and
dry in winter, affording the best of walking, and there are
few cities where the general municipal management exceeds
or is, perhaps, even as good as that of Denver. The
electric street-car service is on schedule time, and the two
hundred and twenty-five miles of its extent already, with
increase in the near future, is certainly an achievement
for a young city. Nature is a potent factor in this excellent
service, as there is no blocking by heavy snowstorms
and blizzards, as in the Middle West and the East.</p>

<p>The gazer in the magic mirror of the future requires
little aid from the imagination to see, in the growth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
development of Denver, an impressive illustration of the
significance of the name of the state of which it is the
capital and the keynote. With what felicitous destiny is
the name invested in the old Castilian phrase, "<i>A Dios
con le Colorado</i>" (Go thou merrily with God),&mdash;a parting
salutation and benediction. Denver is, indeed, more than
a state capital; it is the epitome of the great onward
march of civilization, and it must always be considered
in its wide relations to all the great Southwest as well as in
respect to its own municipal individuality.</p>

<p>No citizen of Denver has contributed more to the
moral and intellectual quality of the city as one of
the conductors of great enterprises held amenable to the
higher ideals of citizenship, than has Mr. S. K. Hooper of
the Denver and Rio Grande, which is one of the marvels
of the West in scenic glory. From May till October
pleasure tourists throng this marvellous route through the
Royal Gorge, through mysterious cañons and across the
Divide. For it must always be remembered that Denver
is a great city for tourists and season visitors, and the
floating population exceeds a hundred thousand annually.
Beautiful as it is in the winter, Denver is also essentially a
summer city. There is not a night in the summer when
the wind, cool, refreshing, exhilarating, does not blow from
the great rampart of the snow-clad, encircling mountains.
There is not a morning when the wind does not come
again, sending the blood leaping through the veins, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the sun rides across the heavens in a glory of brilliancy,
and the great range rears its white head to the cloudless
blue sky.</p>

<p>The Denver Art League is a flourishing association that
has under its auspices classes in drawing, water colors,
and sculpture. Already many artists of Colorado are
winning a name. A new Public Library is now in process
of erection, and the Chamber of Commerce also maintains
a free library of some twenty-five thousand volumes,
the reading-room open every day in the year. The
city appropriates six thousand dollars a year for the
expenses of this institution.</p>

<p>The educational standards of Denver are high. Drawing,
music, and German are included among the studies
of the grammar schools, and physical culture is introduced
in each grade. The high school building cost a quarter of
a million dollars, and stands second in the entire country
in point of architectural beauty and admirable arrangements.
Besides the splendid public-school system there is
the University of Denver, a few miles from the city; St.
Mary's (Catholic) Academy, and two large (Episcopal)
schools for girls and boys, respectively,&mdash;"Wolfe Hall"
and St. John's College. The Woman's College and Westminster
University complete this large group of educational
institutions which centre in Denver. There is
also the University of Colorado at Boulder, which has
established a record for success under the able administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of Dr. James H. Baker, who, in January of
1892, was called to the presidency after having served
as principal of the Denver High School for seventeen
years. President Baker is well known in educational
circles in the United States as a scholarly man and a
capable college president. He has been offered the presidency
of other State universities from time to time, but
has preferred to remain in Boulder and to concentrate his
efforts toward making this institution one of the largest
and best of the state universities. He has always been
active in the State Teachers' Association and the National
Council of Education.</p>

<p>For three years past the University of Colorado has
held a summer school with a large attendance of teachers
and college students. In this past season of 1906, Professor
Paul Hanus of Harvard University gave a valuable
course of lectures on education, and Professor Hart, also
of Harvard, conducted a course in history.</p>

<p>Over a hundred and fifteen thousand pupils are enrolled
in the public schools of Denver, including all grades, from
the primary to the high school. The latter offers the full
equivalent of a college education freely to all.</p>

<p>The churches of Denver are numerous, and include
many fine edifices besides the large granite Methodist
Church that cost over a quarter of a million dollars.
It is not, however, only the church structures that are
noble and impressive, but the preaching in them is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
an unusually high order of both intellectual power and
spiritual aspiration. The keen, critical life of Colorado's
capital demands the best thought of the day. The
wonderful exhilaration of the atmosphere seems to exert
its influence on all life as a universal inspiration.</p>

<p>The new building for the Denver Public Library is
under process of construction, an appropriation of a
quarter of a million dollars having been made for the
edifice, which will stand in a small triangular park, insuring
air and light, and giving to its approach a stately
and beautiful dignity.</p>

<p>The Colorado capital is tending to fulfil the poet's
ideal of affording</p>

<p class="center">"room in the streets for the soul."</p>

<p>The life is most delightful. Without any undue and
commonplace formalities, yet always within that fine
etiquette which is the unconscious result of good breeding,
the meeting and mingling has a cordial and sincere basis
that lends significance to social life. The numerous clubs,
and the associations for art and music, for Italian, French,
and German readings, are all vital and prominent in the
city, and the political equality of woman imparts to
conversation a tone of wider thought and higher importance
than is elsewhere invariably found.</p>

<p>Denver, which should be the capital city of the
United States, is pre-eminently the convention city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Even with all the beauty of Washington and the vast
sums that have been expended within the past fifteen
years in the incomparable structure for the Library of Congress,
and in other fine public buildings, and the splendor
of the private residence region,&mdash;even with all this, and
the fact that the Capitol itself is one of the notable
architectural creations of the world, the nation is great
enough and rich enough to found a new capital which
should far surpass the present one, however fine that
present one may be. However great are the treasures
of art and architecture in Washington, the change could
be, even now, made with the greatest advantage for the
future. Within a quarter of a century all that invests
Washington with such charm in architectural beauty
and in art could be more than duplicated in Denver.
The nation has wealth enough, and the most modern
ideas and inspirations in these lines surpass those of any
previous age or decade. The present is "the heir of all
the ages."</p>

<p>No one need marvel that Denver ranks as the western
metropolis of the Union, with its delightful climate,
its infinite interests, its centre as a point for charming
excursions, and its sixteen railroad lines.</p>

<p>In this atmosphere of opportunity and privilege there
is, indeed, "room for the soul" and all that the poet's
phrase suggests. There is room for all noble and generous
development; for the expansion of the spirit to ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>press
itself in all loveliness of life, all splendid energy
of achievement; and in all that makes for the supreme
aim of a nation,&mdash;that of a Christian civilization,&mdash;no
city can offer greater scope than does Denver the
Beautiful.</p>

<div class="verse"><i>And turned the drowsy world to flame.</i>"</div>


<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Emerson</span></p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the picturesque region of Pike's Peak there is grouped
such an array of scenic wonders as are unrivalled, within
the limits of any corresponding area, in the entire world.
To this region Colorado Springs is the gateway, and the
poetic little city is already famous as one of the world
resorts whose charm is not exclusively restricted to the
summer. The winter is also alluring, for Colorado is the
land of perpetual sunshine. One turns off the steam heat
and sits with open windows in December. The air is
electric, exhilarating. The cogwheel road up Pike's Peak
is stopped; but almost any of the other excursions one
can take as enjoyably as in summer. The East is, apparently,
under the delusion that the land is covered
with snow up to the very summit of Pike's Peak. On
the contrary, the ground is bare and dry; the birds are
singing, the sun shines for all, and the everlasting hills
silhouette themselves against the blue sky in all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
grandeur. One easily slips into all the charm and fascination
of Colorado days through these resplendent winters,
when there are two hours more of light and sunshine
in Colorado, on account of its altitude, than in any
state to the eastward. The climate of Colorado Springs
has a perfection that is remarked even in the Centennial
State, where, in every part, the climate is unsurpassed in
sunshine and exhilaration. Especially, however, is Colorado
Springs a summer resort, as is Saratoga or Newport
or Bar Harbor. Its season is increasingly brilliant and
crowded. People come to stay a day and prolong it to a
week, or come for a week and prolong their stay to a
month. The driving is fine, the motor cars are abundant,
the excursions are delightful, and the air is as curative and
exhilarating as is possible to conceive. The inner glories
of the Rocky Mountains, with their vast cañons and giant
peaks; their waterfalls dashing over precipices hundreds
of feet in height; the fascinating glens and mesas for
camping excursions, or for scientific research and study,
are all reached by this gateway of Colorado Springs.</p>

<p>Pike's Peak, this stupendous continental monument,
dominates the entire region. The atmospheric effects
around its summit offer a perpetual panorama of kaleidoscopic
changes of color and cloud-forms. Looking out on
the Peak from Colorado Springs, three miles from its base,
there are hours when it seems to be actually approaching
with such swift though stately measure that one involuntarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
shrinks back from the window in irrational alarm
lest the grim monster shall bear down upon it, with a
force inevitable as Fate; disastrous as a colossal iceberg
wandering from Polar seas and sweeping down with irresistible
force against the side of a transatlantic liner.
In a lightning flash of instantaneous, unreasoning vision,
one beholds in imagination the impending destruction
of a city. It becomes a thing endowed with volition; a
weird, uncanny monster, the abode of the gods who have
reared their monuments and established their pleasure-grounds
in their strange, fantastic garden at its foot.</p>

<p>Again, the Peak enfolds itself in clouds and, secure in
this drapery, retires altogether from sight, as if weary of
being the object of public view. It is as if the inmates
of a house, feeling an invasion of public interest, should
turn off the lights, draw the curtains, and close the shutters
as a forcible intimation of their preference for privacy
and their decision to exclude the madding crowd.
Sometimes the Peak will flaunt itself in glorious apparel
and gird itself in strength. With light it will deck itself
as with a garment. It surprises a sunrise with the reflection
of glory transfigured into unspeakable resplendence.
It is the royal monarch to which every inhabitant of the
Pike's Peak region, every sojourner in the land, must pay
his tribute. The day is fair or foul according as Pike's
Peak shall smile or frown. All the cycles of the eternal
ages have left on its summit their records,&mdash;the silent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
hidden romance of the air. The scientist alone may translate
this aërial hieroglyphic.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"Omens and signs that fill the air</div>
<div class="verse">To him authentic witness bear."</div>
</div></div>

<p>This monumental peak of the continent shrouds in
oblivion its mystic past, and still the handwriting on
the wall may be read by him who holds the key to all
this necromancy. The record of the ages is written on
parchment that will never crumble. The mysteries of the
very creation itself,&mdash;of all this vast and marvellous
West,&mdash;of infinite expanse of sea and of volcanic fires
that swallowed up the waters and crystallized them into
granite and porphyry,&mdash;this very record of Titanic processes
is written, in mystic characters, in that far upper air
where the lofty Peak reigns in unapproachable majesty.
For while there are other peaks in the Rocky Mountains
as high,&mdash;and Long's Peak even exceeds it in altitude,&mdash;there
is no other which rises so distinctly alone and which
so supremely dominates an infinite plateau that extends,
like the ocean, beyond the limit of vision.</p>

<p>There is one glory of the moon and another glory of
the stars, as well as the glory of the sun, in this mountain
region of Colorado Springs. The sunsets over the mountains
are marked by the most gorgeous phenomena of color
before whose intensity all the hues of a painter's palette
pale. The gates of the New Jerusalem seem to open.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>Great masses of billowy clouds in deepest, burning gold
hang in the air; the rainbow hues of all the summers that
have shone upon earth since the first rainbow was set in
the heavens, reflect themselves in a thousand shimmering
cloud-shapes. It is one of the definite things of the tourist's
day to watch from the western terrace of "The
Antlers" these unrivalled sunset effects; and when, later
(still in compliance with the unwritten laws that prevail in
the Empire of Transcendent Beauty), dinner is served at
small tables on the terrace,&mdash;where the flowers that form the
centrepiece of each table, the gleam of exquisite cut glass
and silver, and the music from an orchestra hidden behind
the palms and tall roses that fling a thousand fragrances
on the enchanted air all blend as elements of the faëry
scene whose background is a panoramic picture of mountains
and sky,&mdash;the visitor realizes an atmosphere of enchantment
that one might well cross a continent to gain.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p055.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">SUMMIT OF PIKE'S PEAK, COLORADO</p>

<p>Again, there is the glory of the night. A young moon
glances shyly over the mountain summit and swiftly retires
to her mysterious realms on the other side. Each ensuing
night she ventures still further afield, gazing still longer
at the world she is visiting before she again wings her
flight down the western sky, pausing, for a tremulous
moment, on the very crest of the mountains ere she is lost
to sight in the vague distance beyond. The stars come
and go in impressive troops and processions. They float
up from behind the mountains till one questions as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
whether the other side is not a vast realm of star-dust in
process of crystallizing into planets and stars. Has one,
then, at last arrived at the Land that is the forge of the
gods who create it? May one here surprise the very
secrets of the Universe? Perhaps some dim, mysterious
under-world lies over that colossal range in which celestial
mechanism is at work sending forth and withdrawing the
shining planetary visitants, so continuous is the procession
of stars through all the hours of the night. Each star, as it
rises over the mountains or sets behind them, pauses for an
instant on the crest for a preliminary survey, or a parting
glance, of the world it is entering or leaving.</p>

<p>It is still in the realms of doubt as to whether there
may be discovered a royal road to learning; but a royal
road to the summit of Pike's Peak, more than fourteen
thousand feet above sea level, has been, since 1890, an
accomplished fact in the Manitou and Pike's Peak cogwheel
road, starting from Engleman's Glen, one of the
famous resorts of Manitou. This lovely town, that dreams
away its summer at the base of Pike's Peak guarded by
precipitous mountain walls, is connected with Colorado
Springs by electric trolley, and the little journey of four
miles is one of the pleasure excursions of the region. The
route lies past the "Garden of the Gods," where the
curious shapes of red sandstone loom up like spectral
forms in some Inferno.</p>

<p>Like Naples, Colorado Springs is the paradise of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
tourist, offering a new excursion for every day in the season;
and there are few of these whose route does not include
lovely Manitou, which is also the objective point
from which to fare forth on this journey above the clouds,
into those mysterious realms where he who listens aright
may hear spoken the words which it is not lawful for man
to utter. The journey into aërial spaces opens in a defile
of one of the deep cañons, the train on the one hand
clinging to the wall, while on the other one looks down a
vast precipice, at the foot of which dashes a river over
gigantic boulders. The route is diversified by the little
stations on the way,&mdash;Minnehaha, whose waterfall indeed
laughs in the air, and is given back in a thousand ghostly
echoes; the Half-Way House, nestling under the pinnacled
rocks of Hell Gate&mdash;must one always pass through
the portals of Hades on his way to Paradise? Strange
and grotesque scenery companions the way. On the
mountain-side one finds&mdash;of all things&mdash;a newspaper
office, where a souvenir daily paper is issued with all the
news of that new world above the clouds, Pike's Peak.
The ascent is very steep in places. The verdure of the
foothills vanishes, the trees cease to invade this upper
air, and only the dwarfed aspen shivers in the breeze as
it clings to some barren rock. New vistas open. The
world of day and daylight duties is left behind. Gaunt,
spectral rocks in uncanny shapes haunt the way. The
air grows chill; car windows are closed, and warm wraps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
are at a premium. But the scene below! The sensation
of looking down on the clouds, the view of Lake Moraine,
an inland sea high in the mountains; the new sensations
of the rarefied air,&mdash;all these seem to initiate one into a
new world. From the summit, reached in a journey of
ninety minutes, the view can only be described as that of
unspeakable awe and sublimity. An expanse of sixty
thousand miles is open to the gaze. To the west rise
a thousand towering peaks, snow clad, in a majesty of
effect beyond power of portrayal. To the east the vast
plateaus stretch into infinite space. Below, the sun shines
on floating clouds in all gleams of color. In the steel
tower of the new Summit Hotel is a powerful telescope
that brings Denver, eighty miles distant, into near and
distinct view. In Colorado Springs, fourteen miles "as
the crow flies," the telescopic view even reveals the signs
on the streets so they may be plainly read. In close
range of vision appear Pueblo, Cripple Creek, Victor,
Goldfield, Independence, and Manitou.</p>

<p>The surface of the top of Pike's Peak comprises several
acres of level land thickly strewn with large blocks of
rough granite of varying size,&mdash;blocks that are almost
wholly in a regular rectangular shape, as if prepared for
some Titanic scheme of architecture. The highest telegraph
office in the world is located here, and the usual
souvenir shop of every summer resort offers its tempting
remembrances, all of which are closely associated with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<i>genus loci</i>, and are all a very part of the Colorado productions.
A powerful searchlight was placed on Pike's
Peak during the summer of 1906, adding the most picturesque
feature of night to all the surrounding country.
Denver, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, the Cripple Creek district,
the deep cañons of the Cheyenne range, the silvery
expanse of Broadmoor, whose attractive casino is a centre
of evening gatherings,&mdash;all these points in the great landscape
are swept with the illumination from the highest
searchlight in the world to-day.</p>

<p>A century has passed since Major Zebulon Montgomery
Pike first discovered the shadowy crest of the
mountain peak that immortalizes his name. It was on
November 13, 1806, that the attention of Major Pike
and his party was arrested by what at first looked to
them as a light blue cloud in the sky, toward which
they marched for ten days before arriving at the base
of the mountain. The story of this journey is one of the
dramatic records in the national archives. Major Pike
and his men left St. Louis on July 15, 1806, on his trip to
the Rocky Mountains, or Mexican Mountains as he called
them at the time. He pronounced the country through
which he travelled to be so devoid of sustenance for
human beings that it would serve as a barrier, for all
time, in the expansion of the United States. In vivid
contrast are the conditions to-day. Major Pike could now
make his journey from St. Louis to Pike's Peak over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
either of several grand trunk railways equipped with all
the modern luxuries of travel. Where he passed great
herds of buffalo, he would now see cattle grazing in equal
numbers on the prairies. The vast plains that paralyzed
his imagination by their desolate aspects are now dotted
with prosperous farms or ranches. The mountains that
appealed to him only for their scenic grandeur have been
found to be the treasure vaults of nature that were
only waiting to be conquered by the hardy frontiersmen
who followed him nearly half a century later. The great
white mountain that he declared could not be ascended by
a human being is now the objective point of a hundred
thousand tourists annually, who gayly climb the height
in a swift trip made in a luxurious Pullman observation
car. The first attempt of the Pike party to
ascend the peak was a failure, and Major Pike expressed
his opinion that "no human being could ascend to its
pinnacle." In 1819 Hon. John C. Calhoun, then
Secretary of War, sent Major Long and a party on an
expedition to the Rocky Mountains, then almost as
unknown as the Himalayas. This exploring party
camped on the present site of Colorado Springs, and
on July 13 (1819) started to ascend the peak. On the
first day they made only two miles, as the ground was
covered with loose, crumbling granite. On the second
day, however, they succeeded; the first ascent of Pike's
Peak thus having been made on July 14, 1819. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
chronicle of this ascent describes the point above
which the timber line disappears as one "of astonishing
beauty and of great interest as to its productions."
The first woman to stand on the summit of
Pike's Peak was Mrs. James H. Holmes, in August
of 1858.</p>

<p>General Zebulon Montgomery Pike achieved distinction
both as an explorer and a brave soldier. He was but
twenty-seven years of age when he was chosen to lead the
most important military expedition of the day, and eight
years later, as Brigadier-General, he commanded the
troops that captured the British stronghold at York
(now Toronto), Canada, and here he met his death, which
has been compared to that of Nelson. The captured flag
of the enemy was placed under the head of the dying
general to ease his pain. The cheers of his soldiers
aroused the young commander, and on being told that
the fort was captured, he closed his eyes with the words,
"I die content."</p>

<p>In his notebook were found the maxims that had guided
him through life, dedicated to his son, among which were
"Preserve your honor free from blemish," and "Be always
ready to die for your country."</p>

<p>General Pike was buried with full military honors in
the government plot at Madison Barracks, New York. A
modest shaft marks the resting place of the heroic soldier-explorer,
and on Cascade Avenue in Colorado Springs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
directly in front of "The Antlers," there is placed a statue
of the heroic discoverer of the mighty Peak which forever
perpetuates his name.</p>

<p>No adequate life of Pike has ever been written; but
with the monumental majesty of the mid-continental
mountain peak that proclaims his name to all future
centuries, what room can there be for biographical record
or sculptured memorial? The archives of the Department
of War, in Washington, contain his diary, kept from day
to day in this march from St. Louis to Colorado. After
his discovery of the Peak, Major Pike returned to the place
where now the city of Pueblo stands, continuing his journey
into the mountains, thence to New Mexico, where he
was captured by the Spaniards. Hardships of every description
were suffered by the party before being placed
in captivity at Santa Fé; but even the capture of his
papers by the Spaniards at Santa Fé did not serve to
destroy the records of the astute young soldier, who had
carefully concealed duplicates of his papers in the barrel of
his big flintlock rifle, and he was afterward able to restore
them to original form. Major Pike was as tender and
humane as he was brave. In the capture of the party by
the Spanish two of the men had to be abandoned and left
to their fate in the hills. They were given a small supply
of provisions, with the assurance that they would be rescued
if the rest of the party found a haven of safety and rest.
Major Pike kept this promise and, more nearly dead than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
alive, these men were brought into Santa Fé by the
Spanish soldiers.</p>

<p>Well might it have been of Zebulon Montgomery Pike,
in his first eager march toward this "blue cloud" that
beckoned him on and proved to be a vast mountain peak,&mdash;well
might it have been this hero that Emerson thus
pictured in the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"The free winds told him what they knew,</div>
<div class="verse">Discoursed of fortune as they blew;</div>
<div class="verse">Omens and signs that filled the air</div>
<div class="verse">To him authentic witness bear;</div>
<div class="verse">The birds brought auguries on their wings,</div>
<div class="verse">And carolled undeceiving things</div>
<div class="verse">Him to beckon, him to warn;</div>
<div class="verse">Well might then the poet scorn</div>
<div class="verse">To learn of scribe or courier</div>
<div class="verse">Things writ in vaster character;</div>
<div class="verse">And on his mind at dawn of day</div>
<div class="verse">Soft shadows of the evening lay."</div>
</div></div>

<p>In his diary, kept during the march from St. Louis,
Major Pike thus pictured his first impressions of Colorado:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The scene was one of the most sublime and beautiful
inland prospects ever presented to man; the great lofty
mountains, covered with eternal snow, seemed to surround
the luxuriant vale, crowned with perennial flowers, like a
terrestrial paradise."</p></blockquote>

<p>The memory of this hero cannot but invest Colorado
Springs with a certain consecration of heroism that becomes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
indeed, part of the "omens and signs" that fill
the air.</p>

<p>In the early autumn of 1906 Colorado Springs and
Manitou celebrated the centenary of the discovery of
Pike's Peak with appropriate ceremonies. One of the
interesting features was the rendering of an "Ode"
by a chorus of one thousand voices, of which the
words were written by Charles J. Pike of New York,
the well-known sculptor, a great-nephew of General
Pike, and for which the music was composed by Rubin
Goldmark.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p064.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">WILLIAMS CAÑON, NEAR MANITOU, COLORADO</p>

<p>One of the noted excursions of the Pike's Peak region
is the "Temple Drive,"&mdash;a carriage road beginning in
Manitou, traversing Williams Cañon, and, climbing its
west wall. The drive offers near views of the Temple of
Isis, the Cathedral of St. Peter, the Narrows, and of St.
Peter's Gate in the Cathedral Dome. It is fairly a drive
in elfland, and is as distinctive a feature of Colorado
Springs life as is the famous drive from Naples to Amalfi
and Sorrento a feature of the enchantment of Southern
Italy. Manitou Park is easily reached by motor or carriage
drive from Colorado Springs through the picturesque
Ute Pass, and aside from its beauty it has an added interest
in having been presented to Colorado College by
General William J. Palmer and Dr. William A. Bell, to
be used as the field laboratory of the new Colorado School of
Forestry. Manitou Park contains cottages and recreation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
halls, so that all sorts of hospitalities and entertainments
can be there enjoyed.</p>

<p>Of the "Garden of the Gods" who can analyze the
curious, mystic spell of the place? A large tract of rolling
mesas is covered with these uncanny monsters of rocks
in all weird and grotesque forms. The deep red sandstone
of their formation gives it the aspect, under a midday sun
or the slanting rays of a brilliant sunset, of being all on
fire&mdash;a kind of inferno, foreign to earth, and revealed,
momentarily, from some underworld of mystery.</p>

<p>Cheyenne Cañon is one of the most poetically touched
places in all the Pike's Peak region. Of Cheyenne mountain
Helen Hunt Jackson wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"By easy slope to west, as if it had</div>
<div class="verse">No thought, when first its soaring was begun,</div>
<div class="verse">Except to look devoutly to the sun,</div>
<div class="verse">It rises and has risen, until glad,</div>
<div class="verse">With light as with a garment it is clad,</div>
<div class="verse">Each dawn before the tardy plains have won</div>
<div class="verse">One ray, and after day has long been done</div>
<div class="verse">For us the light doth cling reluctant, sad to leave its brow."</div>
</div></div>

<p>Poets and artists have embodied it in song and essayed to
transfer it to canvas; but the grandeur of South Cheyenne
Cañon eludes every artist while it impresses the imagination
of every visitor. It is fitly approached through the
"Pillars of Hercules,"&mdash;sheer perpendicular walls of rock
looking up over one thousand feet high, with a passage-way
of only forty feet. Once within the cañon and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
might as well have been translated to Mars so far as utter
isolation can be realized. In the dim green twilight from
the lofty wooded cliffs toward the Seven Falls one enters
on "the twilight of the gods," not dark, but a soft light,
the sun shut out, the air vibrating with faint hints of
color, the colossal granite walls rising into the sky, the
faint dash of waterfalls heard splashing over hidden rocks
and stones; a rill here and there trickling down the mountain
side; the far call of some lonely bird heard far away
in the upper air; and the soft, mysterious light, the dim
coolness and fragrance, the glimpse of blue sky just seen
in the narrow opening above&mdash;was anything ever so enchantingly
poetic? It is here one might well materialize
his castle d'Espagne. Winding up the cañon, one comes
to "Seven Falls,"&mdash;a torrent of water rushing down
mighty cliffs on one side of a colossal amphitheatre, and
the precipitous cliffs show seven distinct terraces down
which the foaming torrent plunges.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p066.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">SEVEN FALLS, CHEYENNE CAÑON, NEAR
COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO</p>

<p>In North Cheyenne and in Bear Creek Cañons the
grandeur is repeated, and in those the people find a
vast free recreation ground. This privilege is again one
of the innumerable ones that are due to the gifts and
grace of General Palmer, who has had this sublime locality
made into a practicable resort, with pavilions where tea,
coffee, lemonade, ices, and sandwiches are served; a rustic
hostelry, "Bruin Inn," is also provided as a place of refuge
and entertainment, providing against any disasters in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
sudden storms that are so frequent in these cañon regions;
and the bridle paths, the terraced drives on the mountain
walls, and the glades where games may be played, all
make South Cheyenne the most unique pleasure resort
of that of any city in the United States.</p>

<p>In all these cañons the massive, precipitous granite
walls, which seem to rise almost to the sky, are also rendered
more arresting to the eye by their richly variegated
coloring. These ragged cliffs rise, too, in pinnacles and
towers and domes that proclaim their warfare with the
elements for ages innumerable. Visitors familiar with
all the Alpine gorges and with the Yosemite agree that
in no one of these are there such majesty of effects as in
the Cheyenne cañons.</p>

<p>Manitou, the Indian name for the Great Spirit, is an
alluring place in a nook of the mountains at the foot of
Pike's Peak, reminding one of the Swiss-Alpine villages.
Ute Pass; Williams Cañon, in which is the noted "Cave
of the Winds"; the famous "Temple Drive"; Cascade,
Green Mountain Falls and Glen Eyrie are all grouped
near Manitou, and it is here that the cogwheel road
ascending Pike's Peak begins. The Mineral Springs are
approached in a pavilion with two or three large rooms;
the auditorium, where an orchestra plays every afternoon,
seats some two hundred people, who can listen to the
music, sip their glasses of mineral water, and chat with
friends, all at one and the same time. There is a foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
air about Manitou. The little town consists of one
street extending along the cañon, following its curves,
with a few cottages perched on terraces above, and the
hotels, boarding-houses, and the little shops, with the
hawkers of curios at their street stands, make up a picturesque
spectacle. The shop windows glisten with jewelry
made from the native Colorado stones, the amethyst, opal,
topaz, emerald, tourmaline, and moonstone being found
more or less extensively in this state. The native ores are
exposed; Indian wares, from the bright Navajo rugs and
blankets to the pottery, baskets, and beaded work; photographs
and picture cards of all kinds, and trinkets galore,
of almost every conceivable description, give a gala-day
aspect to the little mountain town. The surrounding
peaks rise to the height of six and eight thousand feet
above the street, which looks like a toy set in a region
designed for the habitation of the gods. American life,
however, keeps the pace, and in this mountain defile at
the foot of Pike's Peak were the signs out announcing a
"Psychic Palmist," a "Scientific Palmist," and a "Thought
Healer," by which it will be inferred that an up-to-date
civilization has by no means failed to penetrate to Manitou.
Each year the accommodations for travellers multiply
themselves. Each summer the demand increases. There
is a fascination about Manitou that throws its spell over
every visitor and sojourner.</p>

<p>The Grand Caverns are on the side of one of the picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
mountains, reached by a drive through the Ute
Pass. Beyond Rainbow Falls, and entering the vestibule
of these caverns, the visitor finds himself under a lofty
dome from which stalactites hang, and in which is a pile
of stones being raised to the memory of General Grant,
each visitor adding one. No form of memorial to the
great military commander, whose character was at once
so impressive and so simple, could be more fitting than is
this tribute. From the vestibule one wanders to Alabaster
Hall, where there are groups of snow-white columns
of pure alabaster. In a vast space sixty feet high, with
a dome of Nature's chiselling and two galleries that are
curiously wrought by natural forces, there is a natural
grand organ, formed of stalactites, with wonderful reverberations
and with a rich, deep tremulous tone. To reveal
its marvels to visitors a skilled musician is employed, who
renders on it popular selections, to the amazement of all
who are present. Another feature of the Grand Caverns
is the "jewel casket," where gems encased in limestone
reflect the glow of a lamp. There is also the "card
room," with its columns and its pictorial effects; the
"Lovers' Lane" and the "Bridal Chamber," filled with
translucent formations in all curious shapes and hints of
color.</p>

<p>The marvellous achievements of the engineer in encircling
the mountains with steel tracks on which cars climb
to the summit are seen, in perhaps their most remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
degree of development in conquering the problems of
mountain engineering in Colorado. Of all these achievements,
one of the most conspicuous triumphs is that
known as the "Short Line" between Colorado Springs and
Cripple Creek, a distance of only forty-five miles, and the
time some two and a half hours; but within these limits
is comprised the most unspeakably sublime panorama of
mountain scenery. As the train begins to wind up the
mountains one looks down on the flaming, rose-red splendor
of the Garden of the Gods,&mdash;with its uncanny
shapes, its domes and curious formations. Climbing up,
the vast plain below&mdash;a plain, even though it is six
thousand feet above sea level&mdash;looks like a sea of silver.
The railroad crosses Bear Creek Cañon on a narrow iron
bridge and threads its way again on the terraced trunk of
the opposite mountain up to Point Sublime,&mdash;a gigantic
rock towering on a mountain crest. A landscape unfolds
that rivals Church's wonderful "Heart of the
Andes" in its fascination. Entering South Cheyenne, the
beauty and grandeur of the eastern end of the cañon are
seen by following the narrow course between its rugged
granite sides hundreds of feet in height, reaching a
magnificent and most impressive climax at the wonderful
Seven Falls. No visit to the Pike's Peak region can
be considered complete without this trip through South
Cheyenne Cañon.</p>

<p>The usual feature of the situation as trains circle around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the rim of these cañons is that their beauty is seen from
above. A short stroll and one finds himself between walls
towering a thousand feet above his head. The beauty is
all around and above. The tops of the mountains seem
very far away, and lost in clouds. But in the train the
situation is reversed; for, seated in a luxurious observation
car of the "Short Line," the tourist is carried above the
peaks and cañon walls, which from below seem inaccessible
in their height, and from this startling elevation one looks
down on an underworld of strange and mysterious forms.
St. Peter's Dome, as it is called, looks down from its towering
height with the national colors flying from its summit,&mdash;a
huge mass of granite that seems to stand alone and
to guard the secrets of the depths below.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p071.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ST. PETER'S DOME, ON THE CRIPPLE CREEK SHORT LINE</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p072.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">APPROACHING DUFFIELD</p>

<p>The ascent of St. Peter's Dome is a triumph of engineering
skill. As the train glides along, and glory succeeds
to glory, vista to vista, and cañon to cañon, in ever
changing but constant charm, the dizzy height is climbed
apparently with so much ease that the traveller, absorbed
in the entrancing surroundings, reaches the top before he
is aware of it. It seems impossible that the track seen
on the opposite side of the cañon hundreds of feet above
should be the path the train is to follow; but a few turns,
almost imperceptible, so smooth is the roadbed, and one
looks down on the place just passed with equal wonder, and
asks if that can be the track by which he has come. As
the train climbs the side or rounds the point of each mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
peak, the matchless view of the plains is unfolded
before the enraptured gaze. All description is baffled;
any attempt to reproduce in words the glory of that scene
is impossible. Every tourist in the Pike's Peak region
regards the "Short Line" trip as the very crown of the
summer's excursions, or, in the local phrase, one whose
sublimity of beauty "bankrupts the English language."
These forty-five miles not only condense within their
limits the grandeur one might reasonably anticipate during
a transcontinental journey of three thousand miles,
but as an achievement of mountain engineering, railway
experts in both Europe and America have pronounced
it the most substantially built and the finest equipped
mountain railroad in the world. It was opened in 1901,
and, quite irrespective of any interest felt in visiting
the gold camps of Cripple Creek, the "Short Line" has
become the great excursion which all visitors to Colorado
desire to make for the sublime effects of the scenery.
A prominent civil engineer in Colorado said, in answer to
some question regarding the problem of taking trains over
mountain ranges and peaks that, given the point to start
from and the point to reach, and sufficient capital, there
was no difficulty in carrying a railroad anywhere. The
rest is, he said, only a question of time and skill. The construction
of the "Short Line" reveals the achievement
of carrying a railroad around the rims of cañons and over
the tops of mountains rather than that of following a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
trail through the bottom of the cañons. As a scenic
success this feat is unparalleled. The bewildering magnificence,
the incomparable sublimity, as the train winds
up St. Peter's Dome, are beyond the power of painter or
poet to picture. Leaving Colorado Springs, the tourist
sees the strange towering pinnacles of the Garden of the
Gods, in their deep red contrasting with the green background
of trees; Manitou gleams from its deep cañon;
the towers and spires of Colorado Springs appear in
miniature from the far height, and the great expanse of
the plateau looks like the sea. It is difficult to realize
that one is still gazing upon land. The ascent is more
like the experience in an aero-car than in a railroad train,
so swift is the upward journey. The first little station on
this route is Point Sublime, where the clouds and the
mountain peaks meet and mingle. North Cheyenne Cañon
is seen far below, and in the distance is fair Broadmoor
with its Crescent Lake gleaming like silver. The
Silver Cascade Falls sparkle in the air hundreds of feet up
the crags. At Fair View the North and South Cheyenne
Cañons meet,&mdash;those two scenic gorges whose fame is
world-wide,&mdash;and from one point the traveller gazes down
into each, the bottom depths so remote as to be invisible.
These precipices are wooded, so that the aspect
is that of sheer walls of green. St. Peter's Dome
almost pierces the sky, and as the train finally gains
the summit a vista of incomparable magnificence opens,&mdash;of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
cañons and peaks and towering rocks,&mdash;and through
one cañon is seen Pueblo, over fifty miles distant, but
swept up in nearer vision with a mirage-like effect in the
air. It is a view that might well enchain one. The
Spanish Peaks cut the sky far away on the horizon, and
the beautiful range of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains
offers a view of wonderful beauty. The road passes Duffields,
Summit, Rosemont, and Cathedral Park, at each
of which stations a house or two, or a few tents, may be
seen,&mdash;the homes of workmen or of summer dwellers who
find the most romantic and picturesque corners of the
universe none too good in which to set up their household
gods for the midsummer days. Nothing is more
feasible than to live high up in the mountains along the
"Short Line." The two trains a day bring the mails;
all marketing and merchandise are easily procured; and
the air, the views, the marvellous spectacle of sunrise and
sunset, the perpetually changing panorama, simply make
life a high festival. The little station of Rosemont is
a natural park, surrounded by three towering peaks,&mdash;Mount
Rosa, Big Chief, and San Luis. Clyde is a
point much frequented by picnickers. The "Cathedral
Park" is an impressive example of what the forces of
nature can accomplish. Colossal rocks, chiselled by erosion,
twisted by tempests, worn by the storms of innumerable
ages, loom up in all conceivable shapes. They
are of the same order as some of the wonderful groups of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
rocks seen in the Grand Cañon. Towers and arches and
temples and shafts have been created by Nature's irresistable
forces, and to the strange fantastic form is added
color,&mdash;the same rich and varied hues that render the
Grand Cañon so wonderful in its color effects. This
"Cathedral Park" is a great pleasure resort for celebrations
and picnics, both from Colorado Springs, Colorado
City, Broadmoor, and other places from below, and also
from Cripple Creek, Victor, and other towns in Cripple
Creek District.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p075.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">PORTLAND AND INDEPENDENCE MINES, VICTOR, COLORADO</p>

<p>The district of Cripple Creek includes a number of
towns,&mdash;Victor, Anaconda, Eclipse, Santa Rita, Goldfield,
Independence, and others, each centred about famous
and productive mines. The first discovery of gold here
was made in 1891 by a ranchman, Mr. Womack, who
took the specimens of gold ore that he found to some
scientific men in Colorado Springs, who pronounced it
the genuine thing, and capitalists became interested to
develop the mines. In 1891, the first year, the total
value of the gold produced was $200,000; 1905, the fourteenth
year, the value of the production was $47,630,107.
The total value of the gold produced in the fourteen
years of the camp's existence, to December 31, 1905, was
$141,395,087.</p>

<p>There are about three hundred properties in the camp
which produce with more or less regularity. Of this number
the greatest proportion are spasmodic shippers, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
their production from the efforts of leasers. There are
thirty large mines in the district, each producing $100,000
or more annually. Dividends paid by the mining companies
in 1905 amounted to $1,707,000. Total dividends
paid to December 31, 1905, $32,742,000. There are employed
on an average some six thousand three hundred
men in the mines, and the monthly pay-roll runs to about
$652,189, exclusive of large salaries paid mine superintendents
and managers and clerks in offices. The lowest
wage paid in the camp is three dollars per day of eight
hours, while many of the miners receive more than that.
The average wage per day paid for labor amounts to
$3.44. There are twelve towns in the district, with a
population of fifty thousand people. During the period
of excitement the population was about seventy thousand.
The social life of the people is much the same as
in other towns.</p>

<p>There is a free school system, with an enrolment of
nearly four thousand pupils, with a hundred and eighteen
teachers under a superintendent with an assistant. There
are thirty-four churches, representing almost every variety
of faith.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p076.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">VIEW FROM BULL HILL, RICHEST GULCH IN THE WORLD</p>

<p>Cripple Creek, the largest of these, lies in a hollow of
the mountains, whose surrounding ranges are a thousand
feet above the town. It consists mostly of one long
street, with minor cross-streets, and there are little shops
with chiffons, "smart" ribbons and laces, and all sorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of articles of dress making gay the show windows, and
one sees women and children in all their pretty and
stylish summer attire. There are two daily papers and an
"opera house." Cripple Creek is a rather favorite point
with dramatic companies, as the entire town, the entire
district, turns out, and the audiences do not lack in either
enthusiasm or numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. William Caruthers, the district superintendent,
estimates that this region has become one of the greatest
gold-producing regions in the world; and in rapid development,
and in the richness of its ores, nothing like it has
ever been known before. In fifteen years the cattle ranges
have been transformed into a populous district with fifty
thousand people, and with all the modern conveniences of
Eastern cities.</p>

<p>The electric trolley system connects all the towns in
Cripple Creek district and passes near all the large mines.
This trolley line is owned and controlled by the "Short
Line," and is greatly sought for pleasure excursions both
by visitors and residents.</p>

<p>Electric cars convey the miners up and down the hills to
their respective mines. The class of laborers is said to be
greatly improved of late years, and Mr. Caruthers informs
the questioner that no problematic characters are longer
tolerated in Cripple Creek. It has ceased to be the paradise
of those who, for various unspecified personal reasons,
were unable to keep their residence in other cities, or had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
left their own particular country for their country's good.
When such characters appear, Mr. Caruthers and his staff
guide them with unerring certainty to the railroad track,
with the assurance that these intruders are wanted in
Colorado Springs, and that, although there may be no
parlor-car train, with all luxuries warranted, leaving at
that moment for their migrating convenience, yet the steel
track is before them, and it leads directly to Pike's Peak
Avenue (the leading business street of Colorado Springs),
and they are advised at once to fare forth on this mountain
thoroughfare. The persuasion given by Mr. Caruthers
and his assistants is of such an order that it is usually
accepted without remonstrance, and the objectionable
specimens of humanity realize that their climb of several
thousand feet up to the famous gold camps was by way of
being a superfluous expenditure of energy on their part.</p>

<p>The special entertainment in Cripple Creek is to make
the electric circle tour, on electric trolley cars, between
Cripple Creek and Victor, going on the "low line" one
way, and the "high line" the other. The high line is
almost even with the summit of Pike's Peak, that looms
up within neighborly distance, and the splendor of the
Sangre de Cristo range adds a bewildering beauty to the
matchless panorama. On this round trip&mdash;a trolley ride
probably not equalled in the entire world&mdash;one gets quite
near many of the famous mines, whose machinery offers a
curious feature in the landscape.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>Taking the trip in the late brilliant afternoon sunshine
along this mountain crest, offers the spectacle of an entire
landscape all in a deep rose-pink, gleaming, in contrast
with the dark green of the cedar forests, like a transformation
scene on a stage.</p>

<p>The tourist who regards this life as a probationary
period, to be employed, as largely as possible, in festas
and entertaining experiences, may add a unique one to
his repertoire, should he be so favored by the gods; and
sojourning in neighborly proximity to the "Garden of the
Gods," why should they not bestir themselves in his favor?
At all events, if he has contrived to invoke their interest,
and finds himself invited by Mr. MacWatters (the courteous
and vigilant General Passenger Agent of the "Short
Line") to make the return journey from Cripple Creek,
down below the clouds to Colorado Springs in a hand car,
he will enjoy an experience to be treasured forever. For
the hand car runs down of its own accord, by the law of
gravitation, and is provided with an air-brake to regulate
its momentum. To complete the enchantment of conditions,&mdash;and
it need not be said that in a Land of Enchantment
conditions conform to the prevailing spirit and
of course are enchanting,&mdash;to complete these, let it be
a <i>partie carrée</i>, with Mrs. MacWatters, and with Ellis
Meredith, the well-known Colorado author, to make up
the number; for the keenest political writer in Colorado
is a woman, and this woman is Ellis Meredith. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
name partly real, partly a literary <i>nom-de-plume</i>, and which
is the one and the other need not be chronicled here. The
name of Ellis Meredith has flown widely on the wings of
fame as the author of a most interesting story, "The
Master-Knot of Human Fate," which made an unusual
impression on critical readers. "The Master-Knot" is
an imaginative romance, whose scene is laid on one of
the peaks of the Rocky Mountains. It presupposes
an extraordinary if not an impossible situation, and on
this builds up a story, brilliant, thoughtful, tantalizing
in its undercurrent of suggestive interest, and altogether
unique.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p080.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE DEVIL'S SLIDE, CRIPPLE CREEK SHORT LINE</p>

<p>In her connection with a leading Denver journal Miss
Meredith wields a trenchant pen, and one reading these
strong and able articles could hardly realize that the
same writer is the author of poems,&mdash;delicate, exquisite,
tender,&mdash;and of prose romance which is increasingly
sought by all lovers of the art of fiction. With
such a party of friends as these, what words can interpret
the necromancy of this sunset journey winding down the
heights of majestic mountains, amid a forest of towering
peaks, and colossal rocks looming up like giant spectres
through the early twilight that gathers when the sun
sinks behind some lofty pinnacle! The rose of afterglow
burned in the east, reflecting its color over the Cheyenne
cañons, and even changing the granite precipice of the
"Devil's Slide"&mdash;a thousand feet of precipitous rock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
through which the steel track is cut&mdash;with a reflection
of its rose and amber. Cathedral Park took on a new
majesty in the deepening haze. At the foot of one of its
tall spires is an ice cavern, which holds its perpetual supply
all summer. The solid roadbed, uniformly ballasted with
disintegrated granite, built on solid rock for its entire
extent, and totally devoid of dust, gives to the hand car
the ease and smoothness of a motor on level ground. No
one can wonder that this road, built originally to convey
coal and other supplies to Cripple Creek, and to bring
the ore from the mines to the mills and smelters (a transportation
it serves daily), has also, by its phenomenal
fascinations, achieved a great passenger traffic made up of
the tourists and visitors to Colorado. Even travellers
going through to the Pacific Coast make the detour from
La Junta to Colorado Springs to enjoy the "Short Line,"
just as they go from Williams to Bright Angel Trail for the
Grand Cañon. With this aërial journey through a sunset
fairyland, where the mysterious cañons and gorges lay in
shadow and the Colorado sunshine painted pinnacles and
towers in liquid gold, what wonder that our poet, discovering
her lyre, offered the following "Ode" to the "Short

<p class="caption">COLORADO SPRINGS AND TUNNEL NO. 6, CRIPPLE CREEK SHORT LINE</p>

<p>Ellis Meredith has often pictured in song the charm
and romance of Colorado with the vividness and power
that characterize her poems which are essentially those of
insight and imagination; but in the opinion of many
of her admirers she has hardly laid at the shrine of
the muses any more felicitous votive offering than this
little impromptu.</p>

<p>A summer in Colorado Springs is one that is set in the
heart of fascinating attractions. Nor is the Pike's Peak
region a summer land alone, for the autumn is even
more beautiful, and the winters are all crystal and sunshine
and full of exquisite exhilaration and delight in
mountain regions that take on new forms of interest.
Colorado Springs is not merely&mdash;nor even mostly&mdash;an
excursion city for pleasure-seekers; it is a city of permanent
homes, whose residential advantages attract and
create its phenomenal growth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>To open one's eyes on the purple line of the Rocky
Mountains, with Pike's Peak towering into the sky, in
a luminous crystal air that makes even existence a delight,
is an alluring experience. To look over the beautiful
city of Colorado Springs, with its broad streets and
boulevards, and lines of trees on either side; its electric
lights, electric cars, well-built brick blocks, churches,
schools, and free public library; its interesting and enterprising
journalism; to come in contact with the intelligence
and refinement of the people,&mdash;is to realize
that this is no provincial Western town, but instead,
a gay and fashionable city, with the aspect of a summer
watering place. Manitou, which lies six miles away
at the very base of Pike's Peak, and Colorado Springs
are connected by electric cars running along the mountain
line, and there is a great social interchange. It is simply
a whirl of social life in the late summer, and the rapidity
with which the guest is expected to flit from one garden
party, and tea, and reception to another, within a given
time, reminds him of a London season. In the morning
every fashionable woman drives to Prospect Lake, and
from her bathing in its blue waters to the informal
"hop" at night, she is on a perpetual round of gayety
if she so desire.</p>

<p>The wide range and freedom of life in Colorado Springs
is equally enjoyable. The artist, the thinker, the writer,
finds an ideal environment in which to pursue his work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
This beautiful residence city, founded by General Palmer
in 1871, has now a population of some thirty thousand,
and although lying at the foot of Pike's Peak, it is yet
on an elevation of six thousand feet above the level of
the sea. Adjoining Colorado Springs is Colorado City,
a manufacturing town of five thousand inhabitants, and
Manitou, the little town at the immediate base of Pike's
Peak, with some two thousand residents, to which, in
the summer, is added an equal number of visitors, who
bestow themselves in the attractive hotels and boarding-houses
or who occupy cottages or camps in the foothills.
Colorado Springs was founded in a wise and beneficent
spirit. Every deed in the town contains a clause prohibiting
the sale of intoxicating liquors, and by the
terms of the contract any violation of this agreement
renders the deed null and void and the property reverts
to the city. Education is made compulsory, and on this
basis of temperance, education, and morality the town
is founded. It is laid out with generous ideas and with
unfailing allegiance to municipal ideals of taste. The
avenues are one hundred and forty feet wide and the
streets are all one hundred feet wide. Lying midway
between Denver and Pueblo, the two largest cities of
the state, Colorado Springs is within two hours of the
former and one hour of the latter.</p>

<p>Colorado College, a co-educational institution, is largely
endowed, and it has from eight to nine hundred students.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Rev. Samuel A. Eliot, D.D., of Boston, the president
of the Unitarian Association, was invited to deliver
the Commencement Address at this college in 1905, and
on this occasion Dr. Eliot said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nothing can surpass the academic dignity of a commencement
at a Western State University. The perfection of the
discipline would make our elegant, but often distressed, 'master
of ceremonies' at Harvard green with envy. At our
Eastern Colleges there are still individual idiosyncrasies and
perverse prejudices and traditions of simpler days to be
considered. There are some old-fashioned members of the
faculty who just won't wear the academic gown or the appropriately
colored hood, and there are always some reckless
seniors who will wear tan shoes or a straw hat. Not so in
Kansas and Colorado, in Iowa and Nebraska. There every
professor and every senior wears his uniform as if he were
used to it; each one knows his place and his part and performs
it impressively. The academic procession, headed by the
regents in their gowns and followed by the members of the
various faculties with their characteristic hoods and stripes,
and by the senior classes of the college and the various professional
schools, is perfect in its orderly procedure, and the
commencement exercises themselves are carried through with
a solemnity which is sometimes awesome. I caught myself
almost wishing that some senior would forget to take off his
Oxford cap at the proper time or trip on his gown as he came
up the steps of the platform to get his sheepskin, but no such
accident marred the impressiveness of the occasion."</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>Dr. Eliot playfully touches a fact in the social as well
as in the academic life of the West in these remarks.
The informalities so frequently experienced in recognized
social life in the Eastern cities are seldom encountered in
the corresponding circles of life in the West, all observance
of times and seasons, as calling hours, ceremonial
invitations, and driving being quite strictly relegated
to their true place in the annals of etiquette. In his
Commencement address before Colorado College in 1905
Dr. Eliot said, regarding the several educational schools of
Colorado:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thus in Colorado the State University is at Boulder, the
Agricultural College at Fort Collins, the Normal School at
Greeley, the School of Mines at Golden, and so on. The
result is not only an injudicious diffusion of energy, but real
waste and sometimes deplorable rivalry. Doubtless it is now
too late to rectify this mistake. Provincial jealousies and a
sense of local ownership are too strong to permit of desirable
concentration, and these states are probably permanently
burdened with the necessity of sustaining half a dozen institutions
which must often duplicate equipment and courses
of instruction."</p></blockquote>

<p>Leading authorities in the Centennial State do not
wholly agree with this view. The distribution of an
educational centre in one city and part of the state and
another in a different part, contributes to the building up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of different cities and to a certain concentration on the
part of the students on the special subjects pursued.
President Slocum of Colorado College, President Baker of
the State University, President Snyder of the State Normal
College in Greeley, with other college presidents and
their colleagues and faculties, are devoting their lives to
the interests of higher education in its broadest and most
complete sense; and with their own splendid equipments
in learning, their patience and ability in research, their
zeal for teaching, and their intense interest in the problems
of university life in a new state, they are making a
record of the most impressive quality. They are the
great pathfinders of the educational future.</p>

<p>Colorado has the advantage of a larger percentage of
American population than any other of the Western
inland states, there being only twenty per cent of foreign
admixture in the entire six hundred and fifty thousand
people,&mdash;a fact that is especially to be considered in
educational progress.</p>

<p>The high school building in Colorado Springs; the
court house, costing a half-million dollars; the new city
library of Colorado stone; the thirty-five miles of electric
railway; a water system costing over a million of dollars;
the admirable telephone system,&mdash;these and the fine
architectural art would render it a desirable residence city
even aside from the group of scenic wonders which has
made it famous all over the world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>General William J. Palmer, the founder of Colorado
Springs, is one of the great benefactors of the state of
Colorado. "General Palmer has always been a builder
for the future," says a local authority. "His remarkable
foresight was best exemplified in the construction of the
Rio Grande railroad,&mdash;the road which made Colorado
famous. Colorado Springs is another monument to his
prophetic vision. With an ample fortune he has retired
from business life, but is busier than ever with his many
philanthropies, all of which have an eye to the future.</p>

<p>"At great expense he has abolished Bear Creek toll-gate,
and has constructed a wonderful carriage road
through this beautiful cañon, and will give it to the
people as a permanent blessing."</p>

<p>This Bear Creek Cañon lies north of Cheyenne Cañon&mdash;about
five miles from Colorado Springs. The road
winds back and forth in a zigzag elevation, with new vistas
of enchantment at every turn,&mdash;towering mountains, the
Garden of the Gods,&mdash;that strange, weird spectacle, St.
Peter's Dome, Phantom Falls, Silver Cascade, Helen Hunt
Falls, and other points of romantic beauty.</p>

<p>Colorado Springs has a great park system at a cost
already of three hundred thousand dollars, and with the
buildings and other features projected the cost will be
hardly less than half a million. There are to be floral
gardens, an Italian sunken basin with a fountain rising
in streams, after the fashion of the fountains of Versailles,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
an art gallery is soon to be added to this lovely and
enterprising city. Already the city has Palmer Park,&mdash;comprising
eight hundred acres, donated by the generous
and beneficent General Palmer,&mdash;a park that contains
Austin's Bluffs, from which a magnificent view is obtained.</p>

<p>It is to General Palmer that all the charming extension
of terraced drives and walks in North Cheyenne Cañon is
due,&mdash;the road often terraced on the side of the mountain;
and here and there little refreshment stands, where
a sandwich, a glass of lemonade, a cup of tea may be had,
are found in these wild altitudes. In Palmer Park one
portion has been appropriately named Statuary Park, from
the multitude of strange forms and figures that Nature
has chiselled in the sandstone. Gray's Peak, like a dim
shadow on the far horizon to the north, and the faint,
beautiful outline of the Spanish Peaks to the south, are
seen from this park, while the massive portals of the
"Garden of the Gods" in their burning red are near,
and at one side the rose pink rocks of Blair Athol.</p>

<p>General Palmer's residence in Glen Eyrie is one of the
poetic places of the world. The romantic environment of
mountain cañons, towers, and domes of the fantastic
sandstone shapes, and overhanging rocks that loom up
thousands of feet on a mountain side, impart a wild charm
that no words can picture. The architectural effects have
been kept in artistic correspondence with the romantic
scenery.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>Monument Valley Park is the latest of General Palmer's
munificent gifts to Colorado Springs. It was a tract of
low waste land some two miles in length and covering
an area of two hundred or more acres, but its transformation
into the present beautiful park is the realization of
an Aladdin's dream. An artistic stone drinking-fountain;
a wide vista of trees relieved by a low Italian basin
with fountains; Monument Creek, made to be sixty feet
wide between its banks; the creation of artificial lakes;
and there are included in the scheme conservatories,
rustic pavilions, and botanical gardens. This park is one
of the most extensive improvements in decorative effect,
that is known in any city.</p>

<p>Monument Park is distinctive from Monument Valley
Park, the former lying some ten miles from the city, and
it is picturesque beyond words.</p>

<p>The "Garden of the Gods" has achieved world-wide
fame. The "Gateway," the "Cathedral Spires," "Balanced
Rock," and other singular formations fascinate the
visitor and draw him back again and again. A local
writer thus describes the majestic "Gateway":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Two immense slabs of red sandstone, soft and beautiful
in their coloring, tower over three hundred feet high on either
side and seem to challenge the right of the stranger to enter
the sacred portals. Napoleon, at the Pyramids, sought to impress
his soldiers with the thought that from that eminence
four thousand years looked down upon them. But from here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
geological ages of untold length look down upon the beholder.
In close proximity may be found limestone, gypsum,
white sandstone, and red sandstone, each representing a
different geological era, and each, in all probability, representing
millions of years in its formation."</p></blockquote>

<p>The "Garden of the Gods" represents one of those
inexplicable epochs of Nature's creations as does, only
in a more marvellous degree, the Grand Cañon and the
Petrified Forest. A scientist says of these grotesque shapes
that "their strangely garish colors, red and yellow and
white, in enormous masses, lofty buttresses, towers and
pinnacles, besides formations of lesser size, in fantastic
shapes, that readily lend themselves to the imagination,
are sedimentary strata, which once lay horizontally upon
the mountain's breast, but that some gigantic convulsion
of nature threw them into their present perpendicular
attitude, with their roots, as it were, extending hundreds
of feet underground. The erosion of water, when
this was all the Gulf of Mexico, accounts for the
shaping.</p>

<p>"The gateway to the Garden is really the grandest
feature, rising perpendicularly on either side twice the
height of Niagara, and framing in rich terra cotta a most
entrancing picture of the blue and tawny peak, apparently
only a little way on the other side."</p>

<p>Any writer on Colorado Springs is embarrassed by the
fact that the great founder and benefactor of the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
has requested that his name is not to be recorded in connection
with his great and constant gifts to the municipality;
and while it is far from the desire of any one to
disregard the expressed wish of a man whose modesty
is as great as is his munificent generosity, it is yet impossible
to tell the story of Colorado Springs without
perpetual references to her distinguished citizen, her great
and noble benefactor and founder. It is not too much
to say that there is probably not, in the history of the
United States, all instance parallel to the story of General
Palmer and Colorado Springs. Yet beyond this bare
mention, in which one even thus records that which
General Palmer has wished to have had left without
reference, one is under bonds not to go. The Recording
Angel may not be so plastic to the expressed preferences
of the wise founder and the munificent benefactor of the
charming city; and the vast and generous gifts, the noble
character of the citizen whose life and example is the most
priceless legacy that he could bequeath to Colorado
Springs, however priceless are his long series of gifts,&mdash;these
are inevitably inscribed in that eternal record not
made with hands, on whose pages must ever remain,
in shining letters, the honored name of General William J.
Palmer, whose energy and whose lofty spirit have invested
this beautiful centre of the picturesque region of Pike's
Peak with the spell of an enchanted city lying fair in a
Land of Enchantment.</p>

</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Deep</span> in the heart of the Rocky Mountains lies Glenwood
Springs, a fashionable watering place, where a great hotel,
bearing the name of the Centennial State, with every pretty
decorative device imaginable, allures the summer idlers, and
where various kinds of springs and baths furnish excuse for
occupation. All varieties of invalidism, real or fancied,
meet their appropriate cure. One lady declared that the
especial elixir of life was found in a hot cave that yawns
its cavernous and mysterious depths in an adjacent mountain.
Another continued to thrive on (or in) the sparkling
waters of "the pool," which is, for the most part, a
dream of fair women, relay after relay, all day and evening,
swimming about after the fashion of the Rhine sisters;
and those who do not take kindly to the pool or the dark
and "hot" cave fall upon some particular geyser and appropriate
it for their own. Woe to the woman who interferes
with another woman's geyser! The whole region
around Glenwood Springs is phenomenal. A hot sulphur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
spring boils up at the rate of twenty thousand gallons a
minute. The "pool"&mdash;where the Rhine maidens are forever
floating, morning, noon, and night&mdash;covers over an
acre, and is from three to six or seven feet deep. Two
currents of water are constantly pouring into it,&mdash;the hot
(at one hundred and twenty-seven degrees) at a rate of ten
thousand gallons a minute, and the cold from a mountain
stream. A stream constantly runs from it, a part of which
is utilized as a waterfall in the centre of the large dining-room
of the hotel. On one bank of this pool is a colossal
stone bathhouse (costing over one hundred thousand dollars),
where every conceivable variety of the bath is administered,
and from which "the pool" is entered. In warm
evenings, when the full midsummer moon peeps over the
mountains, the groups of girls, one after another, begin
mysteriously to disappear, and in reply to a question as
to the destination of this evening pilgrimage one bewitching
creature in floating blue organdie, as she flitted past,
laughingly answered, "Come to the pool and see." There
was no time to be lost. The moon in silver splendor was
climbing over the mountains, and the girls emerged from
their dainty evening gowns to array themselves in bathing
suits. A few minutes later they were to be seen
at this mysterious trysting place at "the pool," the only
difference being that some were outside and some inside.
Surely those inside had the best of it. How can the
scene be pictured? From the broad piazza of the hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
a terraced walk ran down through the greenest of lawns,
with shade trees and a fountain resplendent in colored
electric lights. The pool lies in an open glade. Not
far away is one of the ranges of the Rocky Mountains,
over which the August moon was climbing. Tall electric
lights mingled with the moonlight, giving the most curious
effects of chiaroscuro through the glade and the defiles
of the mountains. On one side of this immense natatorium
rose the vast stone bathhouse,&mdash;a beautiful piece of
architecture. Near by the round sulphur spring boiled and
bubbled in a way to suggest the witches' rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"Double, double toil and trouble;</div>
<div class="verse">Fire, burn; and, cauldron, bubble."</div>
</div></div>

<p>A high toboggan slide in one place descended into the
pool, and was much used by the young athletes,&mdash;the men,
not the girls. In the pool a natural fountain of cold water
shot high in the air. The swimmers abounded. Those
who were unable to swim would cling to a floating ladder.
Here in the moonlight the girls&mdash;clinging two and three
together&mdash;circle around in the water, needing only the
melody of the Rhine sisters to complete the illusion of
one of the most enchanting scenes in the entire Wagner
operas.</p>

<p>Rev. Frederick Campbell wrote of this unique place:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is but one word to utter at Glenwood Springs&mdash;'Wonderful!'
If one enjoys life at the most luxurious of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
hotels, here it is at Hotel Colorado. Built in the Italian
style of peach-blow sandstone and light brick, lighted with
electricity, a searchlight reaching from one of its towers at
night and lighting the train up the valley, a powerful fountain
supplied from the mountain stream up the cañon pouring
the geyser 170 feet straight in the air, and views, views
everywhere."</p></blockquote>

<p>The hot cave is as wonderful as anything around Sorrento
or Amalfi. In fact, all Colorado reminds the traveller of
Italian scenery. It has been called the Switzerland of
America, but it is far more the Italy. It has the Italian
sky, the Italian coloring, and the mysterious and indefinable
enchantment of that land of romance and dream.
The volcanic phenomena is often startlingly similar to
that of Italy. This hot cave at Glenwood Springs is of
the same order as those on Capri and the adjacent coasts
of Italy. In this cave at Glenwood hot air continually
comes up from some unknown region, and it is utilized for
curative purposes. The two or three caves have been
made into one, a cement floor laid, and marble seats with
marble backs put in (the ancient Romans would have
found this a Paradise). Here come&mdash;not the halt or
the blind, but the people who take "the cure." The
process is to sit on the marble seat with a linen bag drawn
completely over the entire form, with a hole for the head
to emerge. Around the neck is placed a towel wrung out
of cold water. To see a cave filled with these modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
mummies, sitting solemnly, done up in their linen cases,
like upholstery covering, is a spectacle. The men go in the
morning, the women in the afternoon. One lady obligingly
gave the data of her "cure." Twice a week she migrated
in negligée to the hot cave, and sat done up in her
linen covering, bathing in the hot air at one hundred and
twenty degrees or so. Other afternoons were devoted to
the hot sulphur water bathing, and what with the various
gradations of temperature and the work of the attendants,
the cup of Turkish coffee and the siesta, the process
consumed the entire afternoon. It is bliss to those who
delight in being rolled up like a mummy and sitting still.
But if it were chasing a star that danced, if it were riding
on a moonbeam, if it were dancing with the daffodils,&mdash;if
it were anything in all the world that was motion,&mdash;then
it might have some fairer title to charm. The felicity of
lying about in a state of inertia is in the nature of a mystery.
And one questions, too, whether the spring of life
is not, after all, within rather than without. Let one
take care of his mental life and the physical will, very
largely at least, keep in spring and tune without elaborate
and expensive processes of propping it up. To
disport one's self in the pool,&mdash;there is a delight. Who
wouldn't be a Rhine maiden under the midsummer moon
in the heart of the Rocky Mountains?</p>

<p>In nearly all the cañons and caves of this surrounding
region are found traces of the prehistoric peoples who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
inhabited them. Fragments of pottery, in artistic design
and painted in bright colors, are numerous; relics similar
to those found in the cliff houses are not unfrequently
chanced upon in walks and excursions and the stone implements
abound. The ethnologist finds a great field for
research in all this Glenwood Springs country. There are
carriage roads terraced along the base of the mountains
where drives from five to twenty miles can be enjoyed in
the deep ravines where only a glimpse of blue sky is seen
above, and the saunterer finds a new walk every day. The
mountains branch off in every direction, and the lofty
peaks silhouette themselves against the sky. It is like being
whirled up into the air. The sensation is exhilarating beyond
words. If people could take "cures" getting up into
sublime altitudes like this, where the views are so heavenly
that one does not know where earth ends and Paradise
begins,&mdash;that would be a cure worth the name. Really,
it is vitality and exhilaration that one wants, and it is to
be found in the air far more than in any other element.</p>

<p class="caption">THE WALLS OF THE CAÑON, GRAND RIVER</p>

<p>The Denver and Rio Grande Railway is well called
"the scenic line of the world." From Denver to Pueblo
it runs almost due south, across a level valley, with perpetually
enchanting views of the mountains and curious
rock formations, between Denver to the region below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Colorado Springs. From the great smelting city of
Pueblo, "the Pittsburg of the West," the road turns westward,
on an upward grade, till it reaches Cañon City, and
from there to Glenwood Springs this road is a marvel of
civil engineering. Up the narrow, deep cañons of Grand
River, through the towering granite cliffs, it winds, on and
up, passing Holy Cross Mountain, offering at every turn
new vistas of sublime and wonderful beauty. To take
a day's ride through such scenery, with the luxurious comfort
of the most modern Pullman cars, and a good dining-car
constantly with the train, is to enjoy a day that lives
in memory. Not the least of the attractions of Glenwood
Springs is the enchanting route by means of which one
arrives in this picturesque region. As the train climbs up
to plateau after plateau in the mountains the scenes are
full of changeful enchantment. The formation is interesting,&mdash;a
deep cañon, with rock cliffs apparently towering
into the sky, and then the emerging on a great level
plateau. All along this route, too, are those wonderful
sandstone formations that have made the "Garden of the
Gods" so marvellous a place. Between Cañon City and
Glenwood Springs the very dance of the Brocken is seen
in Sandstone sculptures.</p>

<p>Near the summit of Iron Mountain, which is in the
immediate vicinity, the "Fairy Caves" rival the famous
"Blue Grotto" of Capri in attraction. These caves
(less than a mile from the Hotel Colorado) are a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
intricate and wonderful series of subterranean caverns,
grottos, and labyrinths, with translucent stalactites and
stalagmites, and they are all lighted by electricity,&mdash;a
great improvement on the sibyls' cave, where the sibylline
leaves were read. The oracles of that time were sadly
lacking in conditions of modern conveniences. The sibyl
had not even a telephone. We do things better now, and
run electric cars up to the Pyramids. Nor did the sibyl of
old have a tunnel two hundred feet long, by which her
votaries could approach the scene of her oracles; but
visitors to the Fairy Caves may pass by means of this
tunnel to one of the grandest and most awful precipices
in the Rocky Mountains, where they step out upon a
balcony of stone into the open air, with a perpendicular
wall of rock one hundred feet high, above, and an almost
perpendicular abyss, down, twelve hundred feet below.
Standing on this balcony, nothing can be seen behind
but sheer perpendicular ascent and descent of rock; but
in front and far below may be seen the Grand River,
appearing as a brook, winding in and out among the
projecting mountains, visible here like burnished silver,
and lost there, only to reappear again at a point far
distant.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p101.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE "FAIRY CAVES," COLORADO</p>

<p>At this high elevation the opening of the cañon of the
Grand is seen in all of its majesty,&mdash;the massive mountains
projecting against each other in their outlines, and
the lofty peaks reaching to the skies. The Denver and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Rio Grande Railway is at the foot of the cañon,&mdash;a mere
winding line, as seen from this Titanic height.</p>

<p>The Colorado Midland Road also runs through Glenwood
Springs, whose phenomenal hot caves and luxurious
and elaborate bathhouse have given it European
fame. The twin towers of the hotel remind one of
Notre Dame, and the views from these are beautiful.
The design is after the Villa Medici in Rome,&mdash;the
same motive repeated for the central motive of this
superb Hotel Colorado with its towers and Italian
loggias and splendid spacious piazzas, and its searchlight
from one of the towers, illuminating the evening
trains that pass in the deep cañon of Grand River.
Here is a region that might be that of Sorrento and
Capri.</p>

<p>In Glenwood Springs the traveller may meet Mrs.
Emma Homan Thayer, the author of "Wild Flowers
in Colorado," published in both London and New York.
Mrs. Thayer was a New York girl, one of the original
founders of the Art League, and the daughter of an
enterprising and well-known man. She is an artist by
nature and grace,&mdash;sketches, paints, and writes, and
in both painting and literature she has made a name that
is recognized, and she has charmingly perpetuated in
her book the unique and wonderful procession of
Colorado wild flowers.</p>

<p>Lookout Mountain, rising some twenty-five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
feet above the town, has an easy trail to its summit; the
driving is picturesque and safe on terraced mountain
roads with perpetual vistas of beauty, and many lakes
in the vicinity&mdash;Mountain, Big Fish, Trappers' Lake, and
others&mdash;offer excellent fishing. The hotel grounds at
night are transformed into a veritable fairyland. The
fountains shoot their jets of water up hundreds of feet
into the air, with a play of color from electric lights
thrown over them until they are all a changeful iridescent
dream of rose and emerald and gold mingled with
blue,&mdash;the very rainbows of heaven reproduced in mid-air.</p>

<p>The journey up the "scenic route" has one point
especially&mdash;that at the base of the Holy Cross Mountain
where the train climbs from plateau to plateau&mdash;that
enchants the imagination. The vast mysterious
cañons lie far below, steeped in the twilight of the gods.
The air shimmers with faint hints of color. Above, the
towering granite walls seem to cut their way into the sky.
The faint plash of a thousand waterfalls echoes from the
rocky precipices, and the faint call of some lonely bird
hovering over a pinnacle is heard. The mysterious light,
the dim coolness and fragrance, the glimpses of blue
sky seen through the narrow openings of the cañons
above all, combine to produce that enchantment&mdash;the
"Encantada,"&mdash;that Vasquez de Coronado felt when
he first beheld this marvellous country.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>Emerson asserts that life is a search after power,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Merlin's blows are strokes of fate."</p>

<p>It is apparently a twentieth-century Merlin who has
dreamed a dream of wresting electricity from the mountain
currents to utilize as power to create a new field for
industrial energy. The electrical engineer, who is the
magician of contemporary life, demonstrates that not the
volume of a stream, but rather its "fall," is the measure of
its possibilities of power, and no country is so rich in water
that comes tumbling down from the heights as is Colorado.
The wild streams that precipitate themselves down
the mountain-sides are as valuable as are the veins of
gold that permeate the mountain. Science has now taken
them in hand, and will not longer permit these torrents
and waterfalls to run to waste or to display themselves exclusively
as decorative features of the mountain landscapes.
The General Electric Company is utilizing these falling
waters, and is already achieving results with their transformation
into power which are beyond the dreams of
imagination. The Silver Cascade, which for ages has had
nothing to do but leap and flash under the shimmering
gold of the Colorado sunshine, suddenly undergoes</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent4">"a sea change</div>
<div class="verse">Into something new and strange."</div>
</div></div>

<p>It becomes an important factor in the world's work. For
instance, in lovely Manitou,&mdash;the little town that dreams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
at the foot of Pike's Peak and which seems made only for
stars and sunsets and as the stage setting of idyllic experiences,&mdash;in
lovely Manitou an hydro-electric plant has
been for more than a year in successful operation; and an
opportunity is thereby afforded the interested observer to
see the practical working of an enterprise that draws its
energy directly from nature's sources. The power is obtained
from water that is stored in a reservoir situated far
up on the side of the peak. Three and one-half miles of
pipe were used to carry the water from the reservoir to the
plant. The water has a fall of twenty-three hundred feet,
which is much more than is needed to turn the giant
wheels that furnish the power to be distributed to Colorado
Springs, Colorado City, and the surrounding country.
The mills at Colorado City use this power exclusively,
and the cheapness at which it can be furnished is a potent
factor in making for the success of their operation.</p>

<p>At Durango the Animas Power and Water Company
has installed a plant for hydro-electric energy which will
furnish power to the entire San Juan county. The plant
comprises two three-thousand horse-power current generators
and the station appliances that correspond with these;
and from this plant extend fifty-thousand volt circuits to all
the large mines near Ouray, Silverton, and Telluride. The
"Camp Bird," the "Gold King," the "Silver Lake," the
"Gold Prince," and the "Revenue Tunnel" mines all draw
from this plant for their entire milling and mining work.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>To harness the cascades, which for ages have known
no sterner duty than to sparkle and frolic in the sunshine,
to force the water sprites and nixies to perform the work
of thousands of horse-power, is the achievement of the
modern Merlin.</p>

<p>The Platte River Power and Irrigation Company are
about to establish two electrical power enterprises most
important to Denver, one of which is to supply all the
power that is necessary to turn every wheel now in motion
in the city, and the second is to secure electric power from
the water that is stored in the Cheesman dam and transmit
it to Denver. Responsible men are working for the success
of the enterprises, and it is anticipated that Denver will
soon enjoy the advantage of power furnished at a minimum
of cost.</p>

<p>The Denver inter-urban service for transportation will
be carried on entirely by electricity within the near future.
All the railroads that centre in this City Beautiful are
preparing estimates and making ready to conduct experiments.
The recent tests in the East of electrically driven
locomotives indicate that Colorado, with Denver as a
centre, will one day be a network of electric lines traversing
productive regions and connecting all the prosperous
towns of the state by this most ideal form of transit.</p>

<p>In Colorado it is one of the unwritten laws&mdash;a law
from which there is no appeal&mdash;that nothing which is
desirable is impossible. This is one of the spiritual laws,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
indeed, and he who holds it as an axiom shall perpetually
realize its force and its eternal truth. The entire physical
world is plastic to the world of spirit. In that realm
alone realities exist. For "the things which are seen are
temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."
The faith that stands&mdash;not "in the wisdom of man,
but in the power of God"&mdash;is that which shall be justified
by the most profound actuality. It is that hidden
wisdom "which God ordained before the world unto our
glory." Science has already discerned the connection between
organic form and super-space; and speculations
already begin to emerge from the dim and vague region of
conjecture into hypothesis and theory out of which are
developed new working laws of the universe which are as
undeniable as is that of the law of gravitation.</p>

<p>In harmonious accordance, then, with that unwritten
law of Colorado that nothing which is desirable is impossible,
it was realized that the Gunnison River, a powerful
stream thirty miles east of the Uncompahgre, afforded an
abundance of water to reclaim these desert wastes to the
traditional blossoming of the rose. The Gunnison River,
however, flows through a box cañon three thousand feet
deep. Were it at the bottom of a gorge three thousand
miles deep, that fact would hardly daunt the Colorado spirit.
Immediately some invention, incomprehensible to the present
mind of man, would be made by which the desirable issue
should be achieved. As has been remarked, failure is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
word not included in the vocabulary of Colorado. That
state has a "revised version" of its own for the resources
of its language, laws, and literature. Its keynote is the
invincible. Ways and means are mere matters of minor
detail. If an achievement is desirable, it is to be accomplished,
of course. It is not even a question for discussion.
There is no margin of debatable land in the realization of
every conceivable opportunity.</p>

<p>A stupendous work in development is that of this Gunnison
Tunnel under the Vernal Mesa to Uncompahgre
Valley,&mdash;a desert waste whose area comprises some one
hundred thousand acres of sand, sagebrush, and stones.
Yet even here irrigation worked its spell, and while the
Uncompahgre River held out a water supply, the land
reached proved fertile beyond expectation. But the
Uncompahgre had its far too definite and restricted limits;
no other water supply was available for this region, and
there lay the land&mdash;a tract of potential wealth, but
destined to remain, so far as could be seen, an unproductive
and cumbersome desert region unless irrigation
could be achieved.</p>

<p>To the constructing engineer of the reclamation service
there came a telegram from the chief engineer in Washington
asking if it were feasible to divert the waters of
Gunnison River to Uncompahgre Valley by means of
a tunnel under Vernal Mesa? This implied building a
tunnel from a point totally unknown. No one had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
succeeded in passing through Gunnison Cañon. But the
past tense does "not count," any more than Rip Van
Winkle's last glass, in any estimate of the present in
Colorado. Professor Fellows, an engineer of Denver,
selected his assistant; they prepared their instruments,
their provisions, and their inflated rubber mattress, and
set forth on this expedition in which their lives were in
constant peril; in which hardships beyond description
were endured. The topographic map, for instance, was
made by Mr. Fellows in the delightful position of being
lowered with ropes into the deep cañon where, should the
slightest accident occur, he would never return to the day
and daylight world again. The establishment of precise
levels for both ends of the tunnel, one of which must, of
course, be lower than the other to induce a flow of water,
was another matter requiring a delicacy of adjustment
beyond description. Of their wonderful and even tragic
experiences a local report says: "It all ended by Fellows
and his companion saving two things,&mdash;their lives and
their notebooks. Everything else went down with the
flood. When the men emerged at the Devil's Slide, weary,
bruised, and bleeding, friends who had been waiting to pick
up their mangled bodies hailed them as if they had returned
from the dead."</p>

<p>Of all this story there was no hint in the cheerfully
laconic telegram despatched to Washington,&mdash;"Complete
surveys for construction." The tunnel will be five or six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
miles in length, of which over two miles are already completed.
The work proceeds night and day with the drills
like mighty giants eating their way through the solid granite
of the Vernal Mesa that lies between the two rivers. This
desert region which will thus be reclaimed comprises portions
of three counties,&mdash;Ouray, Montrose, and Delta,&mdash;the
region being at an altitude of five thousand feet. It easily
produces fruit, alfalfa, and grain, and it is also well adapted
to the culture of potatoes, celery, and the sugar beet. The
land when irrigated is estimated to be worth five hundred
dollars per acre. The tunnel will have a capacity for conveying
thirteen thousand cubic feet of water per second,
and there will be connected with it an elaborate system of
lesser canals and ditches that will carry the water all over
this desert tract. It is estimated that this enterprise will
add thousands of homes to the valley of the Uncompahgre,
and that it will increase by at least ten millions the taxable
property of Colorado. The cost of the Gunnison
Tunnel will be some two and a half millions.</p>

<p>Uncompahgre Valley, lying between the Continental
Divide on the east, and the Utah Desert on the west,
comprises the greatest extent of irrigable land west of
Pueblo in the entire state; but the need for irrigation
and the possibilities of supplying that need were so widely
apart that even Merlin the Enchanter recognized the
difficulty, though by no means defining it as an impossibility.
The Uncompahgre River was soon exhausted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
only this apparently impracticable scheme, now happily
realized, offered any solution of the problem. Hon. Meade
Hammond of the state legislature of Colorado secured the
appropriation of twenty-five thousand dollars to meet the
expenses of surveying and preliminary work. Hon. John
C. Bell, the representative for that district in Congress,
gave untiring devotion to the project, and to his efforts
was due the zeal with which the reclamation service took
up this vast work; and when Professor Fellows was appointed
as the government district engineer its success
became the object of his supreme interest and unremitting
energy, and its achievement adds another to the
remarkable engineering works of Colorado.</p>

<p>In this Land of Enchantment almost anything is possible,
even to yachting,&mdash;a pastime that would not at first
present itself as one to be included among the entertainments
of an arid state which has to set its own legislative
machinery and that of Congress in motion in order to
contrive a water supply for even its agricultural service;
nevertheless, on a lake in the mountains, more than a mile
and a half above sea level and some one hundred miles from
Denver the Beautiful, a yacht club disports itself with all
the airy grace and assurance of its ground&mdash;one means of
its water&mdash;that distinguishes the delightful Yacht Club
at old Marblehead on the Atlantic Coast. There was,
however, no government appropriation made to create this
lake, as might at first be supposed, nor any experts sent out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
commissioned to prepare the way. There are numerous
forms of summer-day entertainments that are more or less
in evidence in the inland states; but yachting has never
been supposed to be among them, as preconceived ideas of
this joy have invariably associated it with oceans and seas.
Still, it must be remembered that Colorado is an exceptional
region in the universe, and creates, not follows,
precedents. It is the state, as has before been remarked, to
which nothing conceivable is impossible.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p112.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE WONDERFUL HANGING LAKE, NEAR
GLENWOOD SPRINGS, COLORADO</p>

<p>Grand Lake is in Middle Park, sixty miles from the
nearest railroad station. (With the incredible celerity
with which life progresses in the Centennial State, of
course by the time this description is materialized in
print Grand Lake may have become a railroad centre&mdash;who
shall say? It is not safe to limit prophecy in Colorado.)
At present, however, a railroad journey of forty
miles from Denver, supplemented by sixty miles of stage,
brings one to the lake, a beautiful sheet of water two
miles in length and more than a mile in width, whose
water is icy cold. The locality has become something of
a summer resort for many Denver people, and also, to some
extent, to those from Chicago and Kansas City, and a
group of cottages have sprung up. Some seven years ago
the Grand Lake Yacht Club was duly organized, with Mr.
R. C. Campbell, a son-in-law of Senator Patterson of Colorado,
Mr. W. H. Bryant, a prominent citizen of Denver
the Beautiful, Major Lafayette Campbell, and other well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
men, as its officers. The club has now a fleet of
yachts; it has its regatta week, and altogether holds its
own among nautical associations; it takes itself seriously,
in fact with what Henry James calls the "deadly earnestness
of the Bostonians," which is paralleled by this inland
and arid-land yachting club.</p>

<p>Besides the joys of yachting in an arid state where that
nautical pastime is apparently carried on in mid air, is the
local diversion of climbing mountain peaks that are pronounced
impossible of ascension. This is one of the favorite
entertainments of Colorado young women, who have conquered
Long's, Gray's, Pike's, and Torrey's peaks, Mount
Massive, the "Devil's Causeway," and various lesser heights,
which they scale with the characteristically invincible energy
of their state. The summit of Mount Massive is fourteen
thousand five hundred feet above sea level, and of one of
these expeditions a Denver journal says of this party of
several ladies and gentlemen:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Camp was struck at Lamb's ranch, where, in the early
morning, the wagon was left with all the outfit not absolutely
necessary. The trail sloped steadily to the boulder field,
where the party stopped for lunch. They were now at an
altitude of twelve thousand feet. A cold wind swept across
the range and chilled them, so that the climb was soon
renewed.</p>

<p>"The boulder field is two miles long and seemed five, for
walking over the great stones is a wearisome business. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
end of the boulder field, which is much like the terminal
range of an old glacier, is a great snowbank. From a long
distance the mountain climbers saw the keyhole,&mdash;a deep
notch of overjutting rock through which goes the only trail
to the summit of Long's. It is a gigantic cornice to a ridge
that extends north from the main cone.</p>

<p>"After passing the keyhole, which had loomed up before
them through weary miles of tramping, a great panorama of
mountains stretched before them.... There was a precipitous
slope of rocks jammed together in a gulch. This rises
for about seven hundred feet, every inch stiff climbing.</p>

<p>"The danger at this point was that some climbers might
dislodge rocks which would come bounding down on the
heads of those in the rear. For this reason the orders of the
leader were urgent that the party should not get separated.
The trail at this point led up the sharply sloping eaves of the
mountain roof, from which the climber might drop a dizzy
distance to the depths below. Clinging to the rocks and
hanging on by hands or feet, the party pushed up to a ledge
from which they looked over an abyss several thousand feet
sheer down."</p></blockquote>

<p>In Southern Colorado the cliff-dwellers' region offers
some of the most remarkable ruins in America, and their
preservation in a government reservation, to be known as
the Mesa Verde National Park, has been assured by a bill
that has been recently passed by Congress and which is
one of the eminent features of latter-day legislation. It
is Representative Hogg who introduced this bill providing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
for the permanent protection of those cliff-dweller ruins
which, with those in New Mexico and Arizona, constitute
some of the most valuable and interesting prehistoric remains
in the United States. Already much of this archæological
treasure of inestimable scientific value has been
carried away by visitors, while, instead of permitting this
region to be thus despoiled, it should be made easily
accessible to tourists and held as one of the grand show
places of the great Southwest. Like the Grand Cañon
and the Petrified Forests of Arizona, like the Pike's Peak
region in Colorado, Mesa Verde would become an objective
point of pilgrimage to thousands of summer tourists. In
the winter of 1904-5 Representative Lacey, of Iowa, the
eminent chairman of the House Committee on Public
Lands, made in behalf of his committee a favorable report
on the Colorado Cliff-dwellers' Bill, presenting, with his
characteristic eloquence of argument, the truth that the
permanent preservation of these wonderful and almost
prehistoric ruins is greatly to be desired by the people of
the Southwest, as well as by those interested in archæology
elsewhere. "The ruins are situated among rocky cliffs,
and may be easily preserved if protected," said Mr. Lacey,
and added:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With the exception of two or three small, fallen, and
totally uninteresting ones, all the ruins of the Mesa Verde
are in the Southern Ute Indian Reservation. It is an extremely
arid region, and little or no agriculture is practised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
by the Utes, although they range sheep, goats, cattle, and
ponies on the mesa and in the cañons. It is a poor range at
best, and the Indians appear to need all they can get. Moreover,
the reclamation service has made some estimates regarding
storage reservoirs in the upper Mancos, and it may
be at some future time a part of this land in the reservation
will be irrigable and greatly increased in value. The Utes
are not going to destroy these ruins or dig in them. They
stand in superstitious awe of them, believing them to be
inhabited by the spirits of the dead, and cannot be induced
to go near them."</p></blockquote>

<p>These dwellings are excavated in cliffs from five to nine
hundred feet above the plateaus. Of these, two dwellings
stand out prominently,&mdash;the "Spruce Tree House" and
the "Balcony House," the former of which contains a
hundred and thirty rooms, of each of which the average
measurement is about eight by six feet. Much pottery,
weapons, armament, and many skeletons and mummies are
found in these dwellings.</p>

<p>The later conclusions of scientists are that these cliff-houses
were designed as places of refuge and defence rather
than as ordinary habitations. The parallelogram and
circle forms predominate, and they are often forty feet in
diameter. There are sometimes double, or even triple
walls, solidly built of hewn stone, with a circular depression
(council-chamber) in the centre.</p>

<p>Pueblo is the metropolis of Southern Colorado. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the second city in the state, ranking next to Denver. It
is an important industrial centre, being the location of
the great steel works of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company,
and two large smelting plants in constant activity.
It is a town with unusual possibilities of beauty, rambling,
as it does, over the rolling mesas with a series of
enchanting vistas and mountain views of great beauty.
The Spanish Peaks are in full sight from the new residence
region of Pueblo, and here is the home of ex-Governor
and Mrs. Alva Adams, with its spacious, book-lined
rooms; its choice and finely selected souvenirs of foreign
travel; its music and pictures; and far above all, the
gracious sweetness and charm of Mrs. Adams, who has
that most perfect of gifts&mdash;that of transforming a household
into a home. Governor Adams, although in his
modesty he would deprecate the distinction, is easily the
first citizen of Colorado. Twice the Governor of the state,
he has impressed the entire people with his flawless integrity
of character, his noble ideals, and his energy of executive
power in securing and enforcing the best measures
for the people and carrying onward into practical life the
highest moral and educational standards.</p>

<p>Governor Adams is always greatly in demand as a
speaker, and in September of 1906 he was again nominated
for Governor of the state.</p>

<p>Colorado, quite irrespective of party, is all aglow
with the name of Alva Adams. Good Republicans have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
long been greatly perplexed over the fact that the man
they most desire to vote for, the man to whose guidance
they would most willingly commit the affairs of state,
is a Democrat. The ability, the unquestioned integrity,
the fidelity to lofty ideals, and the great administrative
power of Governor Adams inspire the almost
universal enthusiasm of Colorado irrespective of party
lines.</p>

<p>No son of the Centennial State is more in sympathy
with its individual problems. Born in Wisconsin (some
fifty-five years ago), Governor Adams was about to enter
the Ann Arbor Law School when the illness of a brother
brought him in his earliest youth to Colorado. Its
beauty, its rich possibilities, enchanted him. Here he
married a very cultivated and beautiful young woman,
whose parents came in her early girlhood to Colorado,
and whose sympathetic and perfect companionship has
been the unfailing source of his noblest inspiration.</p>

<p>In an address on "Pathfinders and Pioneers," given
before an irrigation congress at Colorado Springs, we find
Governor Adams saying:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What a sublime moment when the explorer realizes the
fruition of his dream! What fateful hours upon the dial of
human progress when Columbus saw a new world emerge
from the sea, when Balboa stood 'silent upon a peak in
Darien,' when Lewis and Clark upon the continent's crest
saw the waters of the rivulet run toward the West! Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
events compensate great souls, and their spirits defy hardship,
ingratitude, chains, dungeons, and the axe. The curtain has
been run down upon the careers of those brave men whose
praise we sing. Their race is run. The explorer, priest,
trapper, and pioneer have vanished.</p>

</div></div>

<p>"Would it be a daring assumption to consider the irrigated
regions of America as the arena in which the fifth act, time's
noblest offspring, is to perfect and complete the drama of
civilization?</p>

<p>"Irrigated lands were the cradle of the race. The first

</div></div></blockquote>

<p>"I would not decry culture and refinement," said ex-Governor
Adams in this address; "they are the charm
and beauty of modern life, the music and art of the social
commerce of the age; but in their acquirement I would
not give up the robust, vigorous, daring qualities of the
pioneer."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>The Governor proceeded:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They had blood and iron in their heart, they had the
nerve to dare, the strength to do. I do not believe in battle
for battle's sake; but I never want to see our people when
they are not willing to fight, and able to fight. The only
guarantee of peace and liberty is the ability and willingness
to do battle for your rights. Refinement alone is not
strength, culture alone is not virtue. Absalom, Alcibiades,
and Burr stand in history as the most polished, cultured men
of three ages, yet they were more a menace than a brace to
the liberties of their time. In stress, the world calls upon
the Calvins, the Cromwells, the Jacksons, Browns, and Lincolns.
They were stalwart, strenuous, courageous men; not
cultured and refined, but rich in royalty and daring. It is
the rugged and the strong, and not the gentle and the wise,
who gather in their hands the reins of fate and plough deep
furrows in the fields of human events. It is they who have
driven the car of progress and have woven the deepest colors
in the fabric of human happiness. It is true that some of our
Western torch-bearers were not perfect; none of them were
ever anointed with the oil of consecration; around them
surged the temptations of a wild and boisterous age; through
their hearts and souls there swept the impulses and passions
of the strong; if they sinned, it was against themselves, not
their country. Let their frailties be forgotten, and their
good cherished. Often rough and defiant of the conventionalities,
they were ever true and loyal, and most of these empire
builders can stand before the great white throne with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
open hearts. They were the architects, the Hiram Abifs of
these Western empires. They laid the foundations in courage
and liberty."</p></blockquote>

<p>Let no one fancy that Pueblo is a primitive Western
city devoid of electricity, telephones, motor cars, or even
Marconigrams. Let no one fancy it is too far from Paris
to have the latest French fashions. It is hardly an exaggeration
to say that it demands the best and the most
up-to-date ideas of the Eastern cities to be at all eligible in
these Colorado towns. Pueblo has a most delightful club-house
on the edge of a lake&mdash;the lake is artificially created,
and being made to order, is, of course, exactly the kind of
lake that is desired, the water being conducted from the
mountains into a large natural depression&mdash;where great
open fires in every room greet the daily visitor; where
there are large reading-rooms, a dining-room, and a ball-room;
no intoxicating beverages of any kind are allowed
to be sold, so that youths and maidens may at any time
enjoy the club with no insidious dangers to their moral
welfare.</p>

<p>There are many centres of social life; and if Pueblo
people have any other conceivable occupation than to give
dinner parties at night and go motoring in the morning,
with endless receptions of the Daughters of the
Revolution and other clubs, organizations, or purely private
card receptions invading the afternoons, the visitor
hardly realizes it. The dinners given are often as elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
as in the large Eastern cities, as one, for instance,
given by Mr. and Mrs. Mahlon D. Thatcher at their stately
home "Hillcrest," where the decorations were all in rich
rose red, a most brilliant effect, and the souvenirs were
India ink reproductions of old castles on white satin.
The dinner cards held each a quotation from the poets.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pueblo is always all sunshine and radiance, and has a
beauty of location that makes it notable, with its encircling
blue mountains and picturesque mesas, and the perpetual
benediction of the Spanish Peaks silhouetted against
the western sky. Its new library is the pride and delight
of every citizen. It is one of the Carnegie chain,&mdash;a
large, two-story and basement structure of white Colorado
stone, the interior finished with the richly variegated
Colorado marble which is used for mantels and fireplaces.
The book stacks, the spacious and splendid reading-room,
the children's room, and the smaller ones for reference and
special study, are all planned on the latest and most
perfect models.</p>

<p>The library is in the Royal Park, on the crest of one of
the mesas, very near the home of Governor Adams. It is
a library to delight the heart of the book-lover. Pueblo
offers, indeed, great attractions to all who incline to this
land of sunshine. The climate is even more mild than
that of Denver, from which city it is a little over three
hours distant by the fast trains, or four hours by slower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
ones. Colorado Springs lies between&mdash;two hours from
Denver and a little over one hour from Pueblo. The location
combines many attractions. With three railroads;
its large industries in smelting and steel; its excellent
schools, both public and private; its churches, its daily
newspapers; its library; and its fine clubhouse, open to
families,&mdash;women and children as well as men enjoying it
freely,&mdash;Pueblo seems one of the most delightful of places.
It has large wealth and a power of initiating many opportunities.
It is on the most picturesque and delightful
lines of travel to Cañon City, Salida, Leadville, Glenwood
Springs, and through Salt Lake City to the Pacific
Coast; or on the line to Arizona and the Grand Cañon
of the Colorado, and on to Los Angeles and San Francisco;
or eastward to Chicago and the Atlantic Coast; or
southward to Mexico, or St. Louis, or New Orleans.
Pueblo is really in the heart of things, so to speak. The
Chicago papers arrive the next day, the New York papers
the third morning, and the telephonic communication is
simply almost without limit. Governor Adams will step
from his library into another book-lined room where the
telephone is placed, and from there talk with people in
five different states. Once he held a conversation with a
man at the bottom of a mine a few hundred miles away,&mdash;a
man whose subterranean sojourn had the alleviation
of a telephone.</p>

<p>The greatest industrial organization west of the Mississippi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
River is that of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company,
whose largest plant is at Pueblo, and is held at a valuation
of fifty-eight million dollars. On its pay-roll are fifteen
thousand employés. There are twenty thousand tons of
steel rail produced each month, and it is said that this
number will soon be largely increased, and that the
Goulds and the Rockefellers are arranging to utilize the
product of these mills for their vast railroad interests.
The company owns such large tracts of land in Colorado,
New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming; it owns coal mines,
iron mines, lime quarries; it owns parts of two railroads,
besides telegraph and telephone lines galore, so
that by reason of these extensive holdings it is able to
secure at a minimum of cost all the raw materials from
which the finished products are turned out. Upward of
three hundred thousand acres of the richest coal lands in
the West, an empire containing one hundred square miles
more than the coal area of Pennsylvania, constitute the
holdings for coal mine purposes of the company. In
addition there are iron, manganese mines, and limestone
quarries containing the elements which give to the product
of the furnaces and mills qualities that secure the markets
of the Western world. Its plant at Pueblo has become
the centre of a town called Minnequa, composed of its
own employés and their families. The company has
established a model hospital, with a surgeon's department
fitted up with the most elaborate and finest scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
and nursing facilities; a fine library and large reading-rooms,
and a recreation hall and gymnasium for the workmen.
Nearly one million dollars has been expended on
the tenant houses belonging to the company, which are
rented to their employés on fair and advantageous terms.
In many respects Minnequa, at Pueblo, is one of the most
remarkable manufacturing centres in the world, presenting
aspects that invite study, in its extensive resources,
the vast and colossal character of its purposes, and its
remarkable achievements. All employés are given the
opportunity to acquire homes; and every late ideal in
the way of providing opportunities for their care in
health, in mental and moral development, and in recreations,
is carried out to the fullest possible extent.</p>

<p>The company has recently engaged in an irrigation
enterprise in the purchase of water-right priorities of the
Arkansas River for seventy cubic feet of water per second,
at an expense of one million dollars. These rights, which
date back to 1860-62, are among the oldest existing, and
they insure to the company the uninterrupted and certain
possession of the river flow. A court decree enabled
them to change the point of division, and they have
constructed a new head-gate at Adobe, six miles east of
Florence. A canal fifty-eight miles in length is being
constructed from Florence to the mills owned by the
company. The cost of this canal will be some three
quarters of a million. These mills produce over seventy-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
thousand tons of iron and steel each month. The
manufacturing plant at Minnequa includes blast furnaces,
converting works, blooming mills, a merchant iron mill,
a hoop and cotton tie mill, a spike factory, a bolt factory,
a castings and pipe foundry, with open hearth furnaces, a
reversing mill, and many other appliances.</p>

<p>"It must not be supposed, because we find it necessary
to practise irrigation in Colorado, that we therefore never
have any rains," observed a Coloradoan; "on the contrary,
the rains of spring are usually of such abundance as to
make the ground in fine condition for ploughing and putting
in crops, and we seldom find it necessary to apply
water to germinate any kind of seed; only once, in thirteen
years' experience at Greeley, were we compelled to resort
to irrigation before crops of all kinds were well up and
considerably advanced in growth. About the last of May,
however, as regularly as the natural periods of summer,
autumn, winter, and spring occur in the other states,
never varying more than a week in time, these copious
rains suddenly cease and give place to light and entirely
inadequate local thunder-showers. Now is the accepted
time, and all over cultivated Colorado, within a period of
not more than two days, every flood-gate is opened and
the life-giving current started to flowing on the rapidly
parching grain. Corn will endure until later in the
season, but all sowed crops must get one thorough application
of water within two weeks or become severely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
injured for the want of it. Day and night the silent
current flows on and on, among the fields of grain; not a
drop of water nor a moment of time must run to waste
until the first irrigation is completed."</p>

<p>In so exceptional a summer of drought and heat as
was that of 1901 the advantages of irrigation stand out.
Journeying through Kansas, the long day's ride across
the state revealed continued devastation from the lack
of rain. Corn fields looked almost as if a fire had
passed over them, so shrivelled and stunted they were;
but in Colorado on every hand there were greenness and
luxuriance of vegetation and of crops. The result is simply
that, with irrigation, man controls his climate and all
the conditions of prosperity. Without it, he is at the
mercy of the elements.</p>

<p>The Union Colony of Greeley was the first to introduce
upland irrigation in Colorado. Of the method employed,
the "Greeley Tribune" gave this description:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Almost the first question asked by many persons on their
first arrival in Colorado, when they see the irrigating ditches
running along the sides of the bluffs high above the river, and
back from it five, ten, or twenty miles, is, 'How do you get
the water out of the river, and so high above it? It looks
as if you made the water run uphill.' The answer is very
simple. All the rivers of Colorado are mountain streams, and
consequently have a fall of from ten to thirty feet to the
mile, after they reach the plains. In the mountains, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
course, the fall is often much greater. The plains also have
a gradual slope eastward from the foothills, where the altitude
is generally between six and seven thousand feet above sea
level, while at the eastern boundary of the state it is only
about three thousand feet. Take, for example, the canal
generally known as Number Two, which waters the lands of
the Greeley Colony. This canal is taken out of the Cache
la Poudre River, about seventeen miles west of Greeley, and
where the bed of the river is probably a hundred and sixty
feet higher than it is at Greeley. The bed of the canal only
has a fall of from three to three and a half feet to the mile;
therefore it is easily seen that when that grade is continued
for a number of miles, the line of the canal will run in a
direction further and further from the river, and on much
higher ground, so that the lands lying between the canal and
the river are all 'covered by,' or on a lower level than, the
water in the canal. In the process of irrigation this same
plan must be followed, of bringing the water in on the higher
side of the land to be irrigated, then the water will easily
flow all over the ground."</p></blockquote>

<p>In Weld County, of which Greeley is the county seat,
irrigation was extended during 1905 to cover from fifteen
thousand to twenty thousand acres of arid land never
before under cultivation, and storage reservoirs increased
in capacity. It is proposed to cut a tunnel through the
Medicine Bow mountain range and to bring a large quantity
of water through from the Western slope to irrigate
an additional fifty thousand acres of prairie.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>Within the past year there have been two potato starch
factories started in successful operation in Greeley which
are estimated to pay out annually one hundred thousand
dollars for potatoes that have heretofore been practically
a total loss to the farmers.</p>

<p>The Swift Packing Company of Chicago propose investing
one and a half millions in further irrigation in this
county. The products of the Greeley district alone, for
1905, were five and a half millions,&mdash;a fact that suggests
the wise foresight of Hon. Nathan Cook Meeker, the
founder of the town, in selecting this location, in 1869,
for his colony.</p>

<p>Of recent years a remarkable feature of agricultural
progress in Colorado has been developed by the "dry
farming" system, the discovery of which is due to Prof.
H. W. Campbell, who has been experimenting, for some
twenty years past, in Eastern Colorado, in the scientific
culture of the soil without benefit of irrigation. Professor
Campbell says that he had been assured that corn would
not grow at an altitude of three thousand feet, as the
nights would be too cool; but that he can refute this, as,
during the past five years, he has averaged from thirty to
forty-two bushels per acre at an altitude ranging from
five thousand to nearly seven thousand feet. Successful
agriculture is, in Professor Campbell's belief, based on the
fundamental principle of soil culture, and in an interview
he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While the great work now being done by the government
in promoting irrigation enterprises in the more arid portion
of the West and the using of millions upon millions of money
for the building of mammoth reservoirs have value and virtue,
and means the development of many sections that must
remain almost worthless without them, and the spending of
thousands of dollars in traversing foreign countries to secure
what some have pleased to call drought-resisting plants, will
undoubtedly play their part in promoting the welfare and prosperity
of Colorado, ... yet there should also be an understanding
of, first, the necessary physical condition of the soil
for the most liberal growth and development of roots; secondly,
the storing and conserving the entire season rainfall,&mdash;not
only the portion that falls during the growing season,
but from the early spring to late in the fall; thirdly, the fact
that air is just as important in the soil as water, and that it is
the combination of the elements of air and water in the soil,
together with heat and light, that is most essential; and that
when these conditions are fulfilled, Eastern Colorado will
come to its rightful own, and little towns and cities will
spring up along all the great trunk lines, while the intervening
country will be dotted with ideal farm homes and shade
trees; orchards and groves will break the monotony of the
now bleak prairie, and present a restful, cheerful, homelike,
and prosperous condition."</p></blockquote>

<p>While agriculture in Colorado is regarded as in its infancy,
yet the product of Colorado farms alone contributed
almost fifty-one millions to the world's wealth, in 1905,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
exclusive of wool, hides, or live stock. Professor Olin of the
State Agricultural College estimates that there are over
two hundred thousand acres in Colorado which produce
crops without irrigation, by the application of Professor
Campbell's "dry-farming" system. The so-called dry
land, consisting of millions of acres in Eastern Colorado,
averages now four dollars per acre, where one year ago
untold quantities could be bought for an average of two
dollars per acre. The speculative value of this land has
gone up wonderfully under the impetus of the Campbell
system of dry farming. If this system comes anywhere
near proving the claims of its advocates, it will vastly
increase the wealth and population of the state. With
a greater understanding of the science of dry culture it
is certain that the farmers of the state and the state
generally will experience immeasurable advantage. In
the eastern plains of Colorado are embraced more than
fifteen million acres of land which are now lying practically
useless, only a small amount being utilized for ranging
cattle. The claims of dry-culture enthusiasts and those
who have been experimenting with seed imported to meet
the dry conditions are, that this empire will be made
to yield harvests which will support many thriving communities.
In proof of their claims they point to so-called
model farms established at various places on the plains
where the hitherto unyielding soil has borne substantial
crops.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>One important feature in the agricultural development
of Colorado is the extinction of the bonanza ranch of thousands
of acres. Instead, farms are reduced to manageable
proportions, and are carried on far more largely by intelligent
thought and scientific appliances than by mere
manual labor.</p>

<p>The present day Colorado ranch is an all-the-year-round
enterprise. The ranch owner is a careful business man,
who watches his acres and the products thereof even as the
successful merchant or manufacturer acquires close knowledge
of all the details of his business. He sows his land
with diversified crops, rotating hay, grain, and root crops
scientifically for the double purpose of securing the greatest
yields and preserving the nourishing qualities of the
soil. Keeping in touch with the market conditions of the
world, and with the advancing developments of science, he
is easily the master of the situation, and in no part of the
country is the condition of the farmer better, or perhaps
so good, as in Colorado. The agriculturist of the Centennial
State who is the owner of two quarter sections, or even
of one, is altogether independent. The returns from his
business are absolutely sure, and with the certain knowledge
of substantial gains at the end of the season he plans improvements
to his home, and comforts and even luxuries for
himself and family, which far exceed those usually secured
in the Middle West or by the small farmers of the East.
In Colorado it will be found that almost every young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
and woman of those who are natives of the state are
college graduates. Co-education prevails, just as does the
political enfranchisement of women, and the results of this
larger extension of the opportunities and privileges of life
are very much in evidence in the beauty, the high intelligence,
and the liberal culture that especially characterize
the women of Colorado.</p>

<p>Irrigation enterprises in Colorado are far more widely
recognized than is the Campbell system of dry culture;
but in 1905 these enterprises appealed with increased force
to capitalists outside, as well as within Colorado, as a safe
and profitable means of investment. Land held at ten
dollars per acre is, by irrigation, instantly increased in
value from twenty to fifty dollars; and it was seen that
the most favorable localities within the state in which to
raise funds for further extension of irrigation were among
the farmers in the older irrigated sections who have won
their ranches, improved their places, and made large deposits
in the banks through the use of the productive waters
trained to make the soil blossom with wealth.</p>

<p>Irrigation is developed to its highest excellence in Northern
Colorado and in the valley of the Arkansas River.
These regions have been the longest under irrigated culture,
and their value is increasing rapidly. Each year
sees the agriculturist grow more conservative in his use
of water, and the quantity thus saved has been applied
to new lands. Thus, in an interesting and quite undreamed-of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
way, a problem that incited discord and dissension,
that promised only to increase inevitably as larger
territories of land and their correspondingly increased irrigation
should be held, was brought to a peaceful solution.
Continued litigation, and a great pressure to secure legislative
restrictions of the use of water supply, and the constant
irritation and turmoil involved in these disputes,
were all, happily, laid to rest by the discovery of the
farmers themselves that extravagance in the use of water
was not conducive to their own prosperity. In the matter
of flood waters the irrigation experts of the state are
quite generally meeting the condition in their own way.
Storage reservoirs are dotting the irrigation systems at
frequent intervals, and in the dry months the supply piled
up behind the cement dams is drawn off to furnish the
final necessary moisture for the maturing of the crops.</p>

<p>Another possibility of irrigation that is receiving the
attention of engineers is the utilization of the streams for
power purposes. In many cases the power thus generated
will be made to accomplish marvellous feats in the way of
construction, as in the instance at Grand River, already
described.</p>

<p>One of the special journeys in Colorado is that called a
"trip around the circle," affording more than a thousand
miles among the mountains within four days' time; but a
permission for ten days is available, thus affording several
detours by stage, which penetrate into the most sublime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
regions. The abysmal depth of five of the great cañons;
many of the noted mountain passes; great mining camps,
with their complicated machinery; cliff dwellings, vast
plateaus, and stupendous peaks; Indian reservations; the
icy crevasses a thousand feet in depth; the picturesque
"Continental Divide," from which one looks down on a
thousand mountain peaks, where the vast Cordilleras in
their rugged grandeur are seen as a wide plain; the beautiful
Sangre de Cristo ("Blood of Christ") range; the
sharp outlines of the Spanish Peaks, rising twelve and
thirteen thousand feet into the air; beautiful meadow
lands where the blue and white columbine, the state flower
of Colorado, blooms in profusion, and the tiger lily, the
primrose, and the "shooting stars" blossom,&mdash;all these
are enjoyed within the "circle" trip; and it also includes
Leadville, the "city above the clouds," Durango,
Ouray, Gunnison, and other interesting towns. It offers a
near view of the Mount of the Holy Cross, which strange
spectacle is made by the snow deposits in transverse, gigantic
cañons,&mdash;the perpendicular one being fifteen hundred
feet, while the transverse cross is seven hundred and fifty
feet in length; of Lost Cañon, a novelty even in a land
of cañons; and of the Rio de Las Animas Perditas, old
Fort Lewis, the valley of Dolores River, a region of
early Spanish discovery; of Black Cañon and Cimarron
Cañon and Grand River Cañon, whose walls rise to the
height of more than twenty-five hundred feet;&mdash;all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
are but the merest outline and hint of the scenic wonders
compassed within the circle trip. Up the cañons the train
climbs; through narrow gorges with overhanging rocks, on
and on, till a plateau is reached; then more cañons, more
climbing, more peaks towering into the skies, and waterfalls
chiming their music. As even an enthusiast in scenery
cannot entirely subsist on stars, sunsets, and silences,
the luxurious comforts of these trains enhance one's enjoyment.
A dining-car is always on, and the excellence of
the food and the moderate prices for all this perfect comfort
and convenience are features the traveller appreciates.
That dance of the Brocken which one fancies he sees in
the fantastic sandstone formations on the mountain's side
on the romantic route to Glenwood Springs is occasionally
duplicated in other cañons, where these strange rocks
resolve themselves, with the aid of the mysterious lights
and shadows, into a dance of witches, and every shape
springs to life. The train rushes on, and one leaves them
dancing, confident that although these figures may be stationary
by day, they dance at night. Another mountain
slope of the sandstone shows a colossal figure of a prophet,&mdash;shrouded,
hooded, suggesting that solemn, majestic
figure of death in Daniel French's great work entitled
"Death and the Sculptor." The precipitous walls of the
cañon rise in many places to over a thousand feet in height.
In their sides such a variety of designs and figures have
been sculptured by erosion that the traveller half imagines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>himself in the realm of the gods of Hellas. These
innumerable designs and figures incite not only the play
of fancy, but they invite the study of the geologist,
who finds here the primary rock formations exhibited in
the most varied and striking manner. As the train
winds deeper into the heart of the projecting rocks the
crested crags loom up beyond the sight; below, the river
rushes in foaming torrents and only a faint arch of
the sky is seen. There are recesses never penetrated
by the sun.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p137.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">CATHEDRAL ROCKS, CLYDE PARK, CRIPPLE CREEK SHORT LINE</p>

<p>Another group of the sandstone shapes, under the transformation
of moonlight, resolved itself into a band of
angels, and still another mountain-side seems to be the
scene of ballet dancers. The splendid heights of Dolores
Peak and Expectation Mountain, the Lizard Head, the
Cathedral Spires, the Castle Peaks of the Sangre de Cristo&mdash;what
points and groups that fairly focus all conceivable
sublimity they form! Here is a state more than
a third larger than all New England; it is the state of
sunsets and of stars; of scenery that is impressive and
uplifting, rather than merely picturesque; a state whose
plains, even, are of the same altitude as the summit of
Mount Washington in the White Mountains, and whose
mountains and peaks ascend to an altitude of over two
miles above this height. Of the total extent of Colorado,
the mountains, inclusive of parks and foothills, occupy
two-thirds of the area. So it is easily realized to what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
extent they dominate the scene. But great and impressive
as they are in effect, the mountain features have an
undoubted influence, however unconsciously received, on
the character of the people. The effect of beauty on
character is incalculable. When to beauty is added
sublimity, how much greater must this effect be! It was
not mere rhetoric when the Psalmist exclaimed, "I will lift
up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and
earth.... The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil.
He shall preserve thy soul." It is this train of thought
which is inevitably suggested to the mind in gazing upon
the stately, solemn impressiveness of the mountain scenery.
Nature has predestined Colorado for the theatre of noble
life, and the influence is all-pervading.</p>

<p>Great engineering feats are in evidence all over Colorado.
Miles of railway tunnels pass through the mountains.
No mountain, not even Pike's Peak, is regarded in
Colorado as being in any sense an obstacle to any form of
the extension of travel. The railroad either passes through
it or climbs it. The matter is apparently simple to the
railroad mind, and evidently all the peaks of the Himalayas
piled on Pike's or Long's peaks&mdash;"Ossa piled on
Pelion"&mdash;would not daunt the Coloradoan enterprise.
In fact, the greater the obstacle, the greater is the enterprise
thereby incited to overcome it. In the most literal
way obstacles in this land of enchantment are miraculously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
transformed to stepping-stones. But what would you,&mdash;in
an Enchanted Country?</p>

<p>Colorado has four great systems of parks whose elevation
is from seven to nine thousand feet: North Park,
with an area of some twenty-five hundred square miles;
South Park, one thousand; Middle Park, three thousand;
and San Luis, with nine thousand four hundred square
miles,&mdash;all sheltered by mountains, watered by perpetual
streams, and so rich in grass lands as to afford perpetual
grazing and farming resources. Colorado has nearly one
thousand inland lakes, and over two hundred and fifty
rivers fed from mountain snows. Its grand features include
mountains, cañons, gorges and deep chasms, crags
and heights; its mountain systems cover more than five
times the area of the Alps, and its luminous, electrically
exhilarating air, its play of color, and the necromancy of
distances that seem near when afar&mdash;all linger in the
memory as a dream of ecstatic experiences. Colorado is
all a splendor of color, of vista, and of dream. It is the
most poetic of states.</p>

<p>Now the fact that this country has been importing over
two million tons of sugar a year lends importance to the
beet sugar factories already largely established. Colorado
has a future in beet sugar hardly second to her gold-mining
interests, if her interests receive the national safe-guarding
that is her due.</p>

<p>Colorado and the Philippines were brought into collision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of interests by the attempt to reduce the tariff on sugar
imported from those islands. This would ruin the beet
sugar industry in the Centennial State, which is already beginning
to transform it into one of the richest agricultural
states in the Union.</p>

<p>This industry is absolutely identified with the irrigation
interests of Colorado, as it is the arid land irrigated that
offers the best facilities for the sugar beets.</p>

<p>The beet sugar enterprise means remunerative work for
the farmer, good business for the railroads and merchants,
and an incalculable degree of prosperity for all Colorado.
Thomas F. Walsh, of Ouray, Colorado, and of Washington,
made an earnest protest against this movement.</p>

<p>Mr. Walsh is a great capitalist, but while he has not
one dollar concerned in the beet sugar enterprise of his
state, he is a loyal and devoted son of Colorado. In a
convincing manner he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... It is not a small thing, this robbery of American
farmers and home-makers for the benefit of sugar corporations
and exploiters of Philippine labor. It means the ultimate ruin
of an industry that is full of the brightest promise for thousands
of Americans. It means that the people of the United
States shall pay tribute to a trust forever for one of the necessaries
of life.... The removal of protection to Colorado
sugar growers would simply mean that the sugar trust, or
cormorants in human form like it, would go to the Philippines,
employ the peons at starvation wages, and send millions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
tons of sugar to the United States. Would the consumer
here be benefited? Not at all. Has the consumer benefited
by reciprocity with Cuba? The sugar trust has received a
gift from the treasury of the United States&mdash;that is all."</p></blockquote>

<p>And again Mr. Walsh truly says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This proposition is merely a design on the part of enormously
rich, greedy speculators, who are willing to adopt any
means for the accumulation of more money. Money, money,
money! They have already a thousand times more than they
need, and are simply money mad. They propose to exploit
the Philippines for their own selfish ends. Help for the poor
Filipinos, indeed! Imagine the generosity of these get-rich-quick
sharks towards the peons in their employ. Think of
the wages that would be paid, contrasted with the standard
of living in the United States! I'd rather have the people
of this country exterminated than to be brought to such a
level."</p></blockquote>

<p>Regarding the arid land Mr. Walsh said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With the application of water to this land under the
National Irrigation Act&mdash;one of the greatest acts of statesmanship
accomplished under our broad-minded and far-sighted
President&mdash;the people of Colorado will furnish an outlet for
a great population, and the cultivation of beets for sugar will
enable thousands of American citizens to establish homes of
their own. That is what is now being done in Colorado, and
the industry is in its infancy. The people have gone in there
at the suggestion of the government, planted beets provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
to them by the agricultural department, and started a great
industry. There was an implied, if not expressed, promise
that they were to be protected in this new industry. Yet it
is now proposed to place them in competition with the peons
of the Philippines, at the most critical time in the history of
the industry. The people of the East," continued Mr. Walsh,
"do not seem to be able to grasp the great possibilities of the
arid West under the operation of the national irrigation law.
The West, properly irrigated with water that we know can be
developed by drainage, wells, and underground flow, will
easily support fifty millions of people. Think of what this
means! Fifty millions of American citizens owning their
own homes! It is an incalculable addition to the wealth and
strength of the United States."</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the very valuable and exceptional resources of
Colorado is in its stone, which equals the world's best product
in its quality. Millions of tons of almost every variety
of building stone lie unclaimed on the hills and plateaus.
There are quarries in Gunnison County that would make
their owners multi-millionnaires, could the stone be made
easy of access or transportation. The difficulty of the
former, and the high freight charges, combine to delay
this field of development. In Pueblo there is a marbleized
sandstone that is very beautiful. Its "crushing" strength,
as the architectural phrase goes, is between eleven and
twelve thousand pounds to the square inch,&mdash;a strength
which exceeds the most exacting requirements of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
architect. This stone is found in unlimited quantities.
In the country around Fort Collins there is a red sandstone
which is very popular, and this is also found in large
quantities at Castle Rock, south of Denver. Near Trinidad
is a gray sandstone of great beauty, and the Amago stone,
which is used for the Denver Postoffice, is a favorite.</p>

<p>In stone for decorative purposes also, Colorado is plentifully
supplied. Specimens of marble from the vicinity of
Redstone show characteristics as beautiful as are seen in
the finest Italian marble found at Carrara.</p>

<p>Besides the marble for building there are also vast
beds of the purest white marble, which will soon be
placed on the market for statuary purposes.</p>

<p>Vast deposits of granite are to be found in many different
sections of the state. In Clear Creek County, about
Silver Plume and Georgetown, there are mountains of
granite. In the southern part of the state deposits are
found which are used extensively for monumental purposes,
and great quantities of this granite are shipped
out of the state.</p>

<p>Although only a limited amount of work in the way
of development and seeking markets has been done for
Colorado stone, the value of the sales is already an
appreciable source of revenue.</p>

<p>Statistically, Colorado ranks first in the United States
as to the yield of gold and silver; first in the area of
land under irrigation; first as to the quality of wheat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
potatoes, and melons, and as to the percentage of sugar in
the sugar beet. The state ranks fifth in coal and iron;
sixth in live stock, and eighth in agriculture. It is true,
however, that irrigated agriculture is considered to be the
most important interest in Colorado. The Centennial
State is not, primarily, as has often been supposed, a
mining state; the mines, rich and varied in products as
they are, offer yet a value secondary to that of agriculture.
A mine is always an uncertainty. A rich pocket may be
found that is an isolated one and leads to nothing of a
permanently rich deposit. A vast outlay of time and
expensive mechanism can be made that will not result
in any returns. An apparently rich mine may suddenly
come to an end; the miner may have reason to believe
that if he could go down some thousands of feet he would
again strike the rich vein; he may do this at great cost
of machinery and labor only to find that the vein has
totally disappeared, or does not exist. All these and
many other mischances render mining something very far
from an exact science,&mdash;something, indeed, totally incalculable,
even to the specialists and experts,&mdash;while agriculture
is an industry whose conditions render it within
reasonable probabilities of control and calculation. The
great problem which continues to confront Colorado, and
to a far greater extent Arizona, is the more complete
understanding of what Prof. Elwood Mead, the government
expert in national irrigation problems, calls "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
duty of water" and the conditions which influence it as
a basis for planning the larger and costlier works which
must be built in the future.</p>

<p>"One of the leading objects of expert irrigation investigation
is to determine the duty of water," says Professor
Mead, and he adds:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In order to do this it is necessary to deal with a large
range of climatic conditions, and to study the influence of
different methods of application and the requirements of
different crops. Farmers need an approximate knowledge
of the duty of water in order to make intelligent contracts for
their supply. It is needed by the engineer and investors in
order to plan canals and reservoirs properly. Without this
knowledge every important transaction in the construction of
irrigation works, or in the distribution of water therefrom, is
very largely dependent on individual judgment or conjecture....
In constructing reservoirs it is as necessary to
know whether they will be filled in a few years by silt as to
know that the dam rests on a solid foundation; and it is as
desirable to provide some means for the removal of this sedimentary
accumulation as it is to provide an adequate waste
way for floods."</p></blockquote>

<p>The problems of irrigation are evidently highly complicated
ones. There are large tracts of irrigated land
selling at three hundred dollars an acre which, fifty years
ago, were held as worthless desert regions. The value of
water rights has risen from four to thirty-five dollars an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
acre. The Platte River and its tributaries, alone, irrigate
one million nine hundred and twenty-four thousand four
hundred and sixty-five acres. In the South Platte the
average flow of water is two thousand seven hundred and
sixty-five feet a second. The North Platte and its tributaries
irrigate about nine hundred thousand acres. There
are now over two million acres in Colorado under actual
irrigation, with an agricultural population of some one
hundred and fifty thousand, with a total income of over
thirty millions. The agricultural population is increasing
so rapidly that the day cannot be distant when it will
reach a million, with a total production of more than one
hundred and fifty million dollars. It is believed that an
expenditure of forty millions in irrigation at the present
time would immediately result in an increment of from
two hundred to three hundred millions. The irrigation
bill that passed Congress in 1904 proved of the most
beneficial nature to Colorado; not only for its immediate
effects, but for the promise it implied and the confidence
inspired in the immediate future. The encouragement
of irrigation in Colorado is the influence that enlarges and
develops the agricultural efforts, promoting the growing
industry of beet sugar and extending all resources. Beyond
the material results there lie, too, the most important
social conditions of the greater content and industry
of the people and the corresponding decrease of tendencies
toward anarchy and disorder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>In the quarter of a century&mdash;with the sixth year now
added&mdash;since Colorado became a state there has passed
over twenty million acres of government lands into the
individual ownership of men whose capital, for the most
part, consisted solely of the horses and wagon that they
brought with them. Of this vast area there are some
two and a half million acres under agricultural cultivation,
which are assessed at a valuation of some twenty-five
millions. The Boston and Colorado smelter, established
in 1873, has produced a valuation in gold, silver, and
copper of nearly ninety-six millions. In the year of 1905
the Colorado mines,&mdash;gold, silver, lead, copper, and zinc,&mdash;all
told, produced nearly ninety million dollars.</p>

<p>The population of Colorado is increasing rapidly, not
only by the stream of immigration that pours in of those
who come <i>con intentione</i>, but to a considerable degree by
those who come only as tourists and visitors, and who
become so fascinated with Colorado's charm, and so impressed
with her rich and varied resources, that they
remain. The development of this state is one of the most
remarkable and thrilling pages in American history. It
is the story of personal sacrifice, personal heroism, personal
devotion to the nobler purposes and ideals of life that no
one can read unmoved.</p>

<p>"There can be no backward movement, not even a
check in the steady tramp of such a conquering army,"
said the "Denver Republican" editorially. "Before it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
mountains melt into bars of gold, of silver, of copper, lead,
zinc, and iron. It passes over virgin soil, and behind it
spring up fields of grain and groves of fruit. It brings coal
from distant fields, rocks from far-away hills, and its artisans
mould and weld and send out tools of trade and articles
of merchandise to all the world.</p>

<p>"It pushes the railroads it needs to where it needs them,
and the world comes to marvel at its audacity. It finds
to-day what yesterday it needed and to-morrow it must
have. It waits only the world's needs or pleasures to find
yet other ways to supply them."</p>

<p>The prosperity of Colorado is a remarkable fact in our
national history. By some untraced law, defects, faults,
misfortunes, or crimes are always made more prominent
than virtue and good fortune. The crime is telegraphed
everywhere, the good deed is passed over in silence&mdash;as a
rule. And so the strikes, and the outlawry, and the
discords and troubles of Colorado have been very widely
heralded, while there has been less general recognition of
the firm and just governmental authority that has held
these outbreaks in check, and has almost succeeded in
ending them entirely.</p>

<p>In general aspects and conveniences the towns and cities
are under excellent municipal regulations. Leadville, formerly
one of the most lawless of great mining camps, is
to-day a peaceful and prosperous city on a great trans-continental
highway. The Western towns begin with wide, clean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
beautiful streets. They begin with the most tasteful
architecture. It may not be the most expensive or the
most colossal, but it is beautiful.</p>

<p>Northern Colorado is in many respects a distinctive
region of itself. It offers rich agricultural facilities; the
beet sugar factories at Greeley are making it a commercial
centre; the electric trolley line which will soon connect
Greeley with Denver will multiply the homes and settlements
within this distance of fifty miles, and this part of Colorado
is enriched with great coal fields. The latter promise not
merely their own extension of industries in digging the
coal and putting it on the market, but they also indicate
another and far more important result, which stimulates
the scientific imagination,&mdash;that of making Northern
Colorado a power centre whose strength can be applied in
a variety of ways and transmitted over a large area of
country. For more than two years the Government has
been conducting a series of experiments in a very thorough
manner, endeavoring to ascertain the gas values of the
great lignite coal fields between Boulder and Denver. It
has been discovered that the converting of the coal into
gas gives it double the efficiency for use as a motor power
for engine or for fuel than can be gained from the coal in
its natural state. A ton of coal converted into gas will, as
gas, give twice the power that the coal would have yielded,
and give the same power that two tons of coal, that has
not been converted into gas, would afford. In order, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
to produce this power economically, it must be done
at the point of mining. It is there that the gas producers
must be located; and from these points the gas
can be transported in pipes, or can be converted into
electricity and sent by wires at far less cost than would be
that of sending the coal itself by freight. These discoveries
not only suggest that this region in Colorado is
destined in the near future to become a power centre which
will be tapped from the surrounding country for a great
distance in all directions, and will thus render Boulder
one of the most important of Western cities; but they
also suggest the evident tendency of the age toward intensity
rather than immensity,&mdash;toward the concentration
of energy in the most ethereal form rather than its
diffusion through large and clumsy masses of material.</p>

<p>Colorado contains over twenty-five thousand square
miles of coal fields, distributed over the state, with an
average annual product of over seven million tons. No
other corresponding area in the entire world exceeds Colorado
in its great storage of coal, and the state ranks as one
of the first in the production of iron.</p>

<p>There are already fifteen beet sugar factories in operation,
representing investments amounting to over twelve
million dollars, and which are estimated to have produced,
in 1906, an aggregate of some two hundred and twenty thousand
pounds of sugar, the percentage of saccharine matter
being higher than that of the sugar beet of California.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p150.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">SULTAN MOUNTAIN</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>Statistically, Colorado ranks first in irrigation, and there
are some eighteen thousand miles of irrigating canals
already in operation, with the system being so rapidly
extended that it almost outruns the pace of calculation.
Three million acres are under cultivation in Colorado, and
two million eight hundred and fifty thousand acres are irrigated;
the storage reservoirs already constructed are sufficient
to place another million of acres under cultivation.
This irrigated land sells from sixty to one hundred dollars
per acre. Colorado has a reputation for being a great potato
state, and in the year 1905 the town of Greeley alone
shipped over three hundred thousand dollars' worth of potatoes,
while tomatoes are a feature often yielding ninety
dollars to the acre, and celery has been estimated to yield
one hundred and fifty dollars an acre. There are tracts
of from two to three thousand acres devoted to peas alone,
producing forty to fifty thousand cans; and asparagus
grows with great success.</p>

<p>Colorado is a fruit country offering the best of conditions.
The peaches of Southern Colorado lead the world
in flavor, beauty, and size; the canteloupe flourishes with
such extraordinary vitality that it often yields a revenue
of fifty dollars an acre; and the watermelon also grows in
unusual perfection. The valley of the Arkansas River is
the great region for producing melons, and Colorado exports
these to New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and St.
Louis. Apples, plums, and pears grow with equally bounteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
success, and there are fruit farms that with their
orchards and small fruits sometimes realize fifty thousand
dollars a year, when the season is a good one and the
market conditions favorable. The seasons of irrigated
land are largely under control, and surpass those regions
which are at the mercy of excessive rains or of droughts.
So the law of compensation still obtains. The resources
of horticulture, alone, in Colorado are very important,
and they form one of the most alluring features of this
beautiful and richly bountiful state.</p>

<p>In the way of crops, alfalfa takes the lead in Colorado,
as wheat does in Kansas. It requires the very minimum
of care; the land being once planted with alfalfa, there is
need only of turning on the irrigation, and mowing it, at
the right time. Alfalfa produces three crops a year, and
yields from one to two tons per acre. It sells at from
three to ten dollars a ton, and this makes a revenue quite
worth considering. The difficulties encountered everywhere
in Colorado, in every branch of industry, or in
domestic work, are those of securing labor. Wages are
high in every conceivable line of work, but to a large extent
the labor and service, even when procured, is of a very
poor order. In many of the larger hotels employés are
often kept on the pay-roll for two months at a time when
not needed, simply because it is impossible to fill their
places when the need comes. From requirements of the
seamstress, the laundress, the cook, the maid, the farmer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
working-men, or the employés in almost any line of work,
the same difficulty exists. Much is heard regarding
strikes and other forms of the eternal conflict between
labor and capital; and yet the high rates paid, the concessions
constantly made to the demands of employés, the
conditions provided for them, would seem, at a superficial
glance, to be such as to bridge over every difficulty. Domestic
service is something that presents the greatest problem
on the part of the employer. If there is so large a
number of "the unemployed" in the East, why should not
the conditions balance themselves and this superfluous element
find good conditions for living in Colorado? This
question involves the problem of economics, with which
these pages have nothing to do; but no traveller, no sojourner,
can linger in Colorado who is not simply lost in
wonder that the varied work that is waiting, with the
most liberal payments for the worker, and the multitude
of workers in the East who need the liberal payment,
cannot, by some law of elective affinity, be brought
together.</p>

<p>When it is realized that the Rocky Mountains occupy
in Colorado more than five times the entire space of the
Alps in Europe, their importance in climatic influence as
well as in scenic magnificence can be understood. The
forests of Colorado are found on the mountains and foothills.
The heights are covered with a dense growth of
pine woods, while in lower ranges abound the silver spruce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
and the cedar. Colorado has a state forestry association
which aims to secure as a reservation all forests above the
altitude of eight thousand five hundred feet, as this preservation
is considered most important to the water supply.
In the Alps there are nine peaks over fourteen thousand
feet in height; in the Rocky Mountains, within the limits
of Colorado alone, there are forty-three peaks, each one of
which exceeds in height the Jungfrau. There are in
Colorado more than thirty towns, each of which is the
theatre of active progress, and each of which lies at an
altitude exceeding that of the pass of St. Bernard. The
sublime cañons and gorges are eloquent of the story of
Titanic forces which rent the mountains apart. The
vast plateaus were once the bed of inland seas. In the
cañon of Grand River towering walls rise to the height
of half a mile, in sheer precipitous rock, for a distance of
some sixteen miles. The strata of these rocks are distinctly
defined, and the play of color is rich and fantastic.
The vast walls are in brilliant hues of red and amber and
green and brown,&mdash;the blending of color lending its
enchantment to the marvellous scene. Each cañon has
its own individuality. No one repeats the wild charm of
another. Excursions abound. There is "the loop," an
enchanting mountain ride made from Denver within one
day for the round trip; the "Rainbow" tour, and others,
besides that of the "circle" already described. In each
and all these journeys the route is often on the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
verge of the abyss, and the sublimities, the splendor of
coloring, exceed any power of language to suggest.</p>

<p>In Northwestern Colorado, along the White River and
northward, lies the sportsman's paradise, now reached only
by a stage drive of from forty-five to ninety miles from
the little town of Rifle on the "scenic route" of the Denver
and Rio Grande, beyond Glenwood Springs. Trapper's
Lake and the Marvine lakes are well known, and the
Marvine Hunting Lodge is a favorite resort of English
tourists.</p>

<p>Estes Park, some seventy miles from Denver, a favorite
summer resort, is a long, narrow plateau of two or
three miles in width and fifteen in length, a mile and a
half above sea level, and enclosed in mountain walls that
tower above the park from two to seven thousand feet.
A swift stream, well stocked with trout, runs through the
park. The four great systems of parks divide Colorado
into naturally distinct localities: North Park, with an
area of twenty-five hundred square miles; Middle Park,
with its three thousand; the smaller South Park of one
thousand; and San Luis, with over ninety-four hundred
square miles,&mdash;all, in the aggregate, presenting a unique
structural plan. Every journey in Colorado has its vista
of surprise. No artist can paint its panoramas. Every
traveller in this Land of Enchantment must realize that
its exhilaration cannot be decanted in any form. It is a
thing that lies in character, moulding life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>Colorado is the Land of Achievement. It offers resources
totally unsurpassed in the entire world for an
unlimited expanse. These resources await only the recognition
of him who can discern the psychological moment
for their development. That nothing is impossible to
him who wills is one of the eternal verities, and even
the expert census taker, or the supernatural tax collector
whom nothing escapes, might search in vain, within
the limits of the splendid Centennial State, for any
man who fails to will. The resplendence of this state of
stars and sunshine is due to this blaze of human energy.
The Coloradoans are the typical spirits who are among
those elect</p>

increasing harmony with the physical environment,&mdash;none
of these things, important and significant as they
are, touch the profoundest interest of Colorado. For this
supreme interest is that of the noble men and women
whose lives have left to the state the legacy of their hopes,
their efforts, their earnestness, and their faith. "Much is
made of the Pilgrim Fathers who landed on Plymouth
Rock," editorially remarked the "Denver Republican" in
an article on "Pioneers' Day," in June of 1906; "and if
there had been phonographs in those days to preserve the
record of the speech of one of those old fugitives from
European persecution, with what delight the men and
women of this generation would listen to the tones which
come from the instrument! But, after all, were the Pilgrim
Fathers, canonized by nearly three hundred years
of tradition, any braver, any more venturesome, any more
worthy of honor, than the pioneers who fought Indians
and struggled against adverse fortune of every kind while
they laid in fear and hope the foundations of this great
state?"</p>

<p>Among the poems of Walt Whitman is one entitled
"The Beginners," which interprets a high quality of life.
The lines are as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"How they are provided for upon the earth (appearing at intervals):</div>
<div class="verse">How dear and dreadful they are to the earth:</div>
<div class="verse">How they inure to themselves as much as to any&mdash;what a paradox appears this age:</div>
<div class="verse">How people respond to them, yet know them not:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></div>
<div class="verse">How there is something relentless in their fate, all times:</div>
<div class="verse">How all things mischoose the object of their adulation and reward,</div>
<div class="verse">And how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same great purchase."</div>
</div></div>

<p>The price was paid by the pioneers of Colorado. They
poured out lavishly all their hope, their indomitable
energy, their patience, which was faith, as well. They
planted, knowing that not to themselves would come the
harvest. They builded that those yet to come might have
shelter. They gave to Colorado such an endowment of
potent but invisible force that its momentum pervades
the air to-day. The accelerated ratio of power with which
spiritual forces proceed defies even the ablest of the
statisticians.</p>

<p>In all the chapters of American history there are none
more thrilling than the story of the early life in Colorado;
there are no chapters that more vividly demonstrate the
absolutely present and practical aid of the divine guidance
of God acting through His messengers,&mdash;those who
have lived on earth and have gone on into the life more
abundant.</p>

<p>The lives of the remarkable men and women who have
been canonized by the church have left the world the better
for their being and humanity the richer for the inheritance
of their experience. Their history is not to be held merely
as tradition or as superstition. Let one visit in Italy
Assisi, the home of St. Francis; Siena, the home of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Catherine, and follow the footsteps of others whose names
enrich the church calendar, to their homes and haunts, and
their record becomes vivid and vitalized as, to a stranger
visiting Boston, might become the footsteps of her noble
and consecrated lives which are yet almost within universal
personal remembrance: the lives of Lydia Maria Child,
William Lloyd Garrison, Emerson, Whittier, Lucy Stone,
Lowell, Mary A. Livermore, James Freeman Clarke, and
Phillips Brooks,&mdash;men and women whom Boston may
well hold as her prophets and her saints. They, too,
were of the order of "The Beginners." They sowed the
seeds of the higher life. They were receptive to all high
counsels from the ethereal world, from the divine realms;
they listened to great truths which the multitude did not
hear, and they gave it anew by voice and by pen, till all
the world might hear and read and receive it. They were,
indeed,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"God's prophets of the Beautiful."</p>

<p>Such persons were living a twofold life during their entire

link them with those of the great and the holy men and
women of all ages and all climes.</p>

high destiny of sacrifice. Their lives are companioned
with struggle and conflict. Of such experiences as theirs
well might be asked the question so impressively conveyed
in these noble lines by America's great woman poet,&mdash;our
poet who sang the song of the nation's "Battle-Hymn,"&mdash;Julia
Ward Howe:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>The names of many of these heroic pioneers of Colorado
may be unwritten save in the pages of the Recording
Angel; but they live and are immortal in the influence
they have left as a heritage to succeeding generations,
in the trains of thought and purposes they initiated, and
in all that potent power of generous aims and noble
ideals,&mdash;for all advancing civilization rests on lofty ideals.
"While the basis of civilization must be material," says
the Rev. Dr. Charles Gordon Ames of Boston, "its life
must be spiritual. Its end and object must be the soul,
and not the body; and it will provide all best things for
the body, that the soul may be worthily housed and
served. The higher and chief interests of society will
always be intellectual, affectional, aspirational&mdash;human
and humane. The true, the beautiful, and the good&mdash;almost
unknown to the barbarian, and often mocked at by
the Philistines of modern society&mdash;will be sought for as
men seek for gold and pearls of great price. Wealth will
bring its offering to the altars of education and art and
worship. Science, as it searches the worlds of matter and
of mind, will find new and sacred parables and gospels of
grace. Learning will be a priestess of truth. The imagination
of man will wander and wander in the wide
creation, free, fearless, and glad, knowing that the Father's
house is everywhere, and that his child may be everywhere
at home."</p>

<p>In many of the pioneer households of Colorado, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
those of plenty or of privation, the children had the inestimable
advantage of the refined and beautiful atmosphere
of a home in which high ideals and lofty devotion to intellectual
progress and spiritual culture prevailed. If
schools were insufficient, there were the trained educational
methods of both the father and the mother under which
they were reared and taught; and poverty of purse cannot
greatly matter where there is no poverty of the spirit.</p>

<p>Well may these pioneers of Colorado be held as belonging
to that order of humanity which the poet calls "The
Beginners." Some of them were unlettered and untaught
save in the great school of life itself; some of them were
rich in learning and culture; but they all shared in common
a devotion to progress differing only in degree or conception:
they shared common sacrifices; they gave their best
energies to the development of a great and beautiful state
whose increasing rate of progress is to them an immortal
monument. These leaders of humanity whom the poet so
finely characterizes as "The Beginners" are an order of
people always appearing on earth. They are of those
who hear the Song in the air and behold the Star in the
sky. They are the persons who discern&mdash;and follow&mdash;The
Gleam. Their lives are rich in service and sacrifice.
Their kingdom is not of this world. Their lives are not
unfrequently cheerless and cold, but on their altar fires
glows the living coal sent down from heaven. They fast
that others may feast. They accept privations that others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
may revel in possessions. They pay the inexorable price
for the same great purchase. They are those who are sent
on earth peculiarly set apart to co-operate with God in the
larger fulfilment of the divine laws. They pay the inexorable
price of toil and labor and sorrow and sacrifice.
They rise into the everlasting triumph and the beauty and
the joy of spirituality of life. They give all for this; they
find all in it. But let no one resign his hopes or his
dreams. Let no one doubt, for an instant, that all of
goodness and beauty and sweetness and joy that he longs
for is on its way toward him. It is only a question of
time. Let him be patient, which is not a mere passive and
negative condition, but one full of intense activities and
serene poise; let him be patient and believing, and make
room in his life for that immortal joy which no man taketh
from him.</p>

<p>The town of Greeley, with its felicitous location midway
between the two state capitals, Denver and Cheyenne,
fifty miles from each, and which is already the principal
town of Northern Colorado as Pueblo is of the southern
part of the state, has a romantic and thrilling story
connected with its founding. In the history of Colorado,
among the many men whose lives stand out in noble pre-eminence,
was that of the founder of Greeley, Hon. Nathan
Cook Meeker, whose personal life is inseparably associated
with the interesting town which owes to him its origin.</p>

<p>The Meekers trace their ancestry to men who went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
England from Antwerp about 1500. In 1639 Robert
and William Meeker came to this country and settled
in New Haven. Thirty years later William Meeker removed
to New Jersey, and the town of Elizabeth was
founded by him and named for his wife. He was a
leader in the affairs of the day, held prominent office, and
in 1690 he died, leaving the old Meeker homestead in
Newark, New Jersey, which is still in the possession of
his descendants. One of his sons was Joseph Meeker, also
prominent in promoting the conditions of progress, and
he was the grandfather of Nathan Cook Meeker, the founder
of Greeley, who inherited the qualities that have made
the family a marked one in America. When he was but
seventeen he carried on an extensive correspondence with
Henry Clay, John Tyler, George D. Prentice, and other
noted men of the day, discussing with them subjects of
importance, and he was a contributor even in these early
years to the "Louisville Journal," then edited by George
D. Prentice, and now the "Courier-Journal," edited by
the brilliant Colonel Henry Watterson; to the New Orleans
"Picayune," and other leading papers. Even in his
early youth Mr. Meeker seems to have been a man of perpetual
aspiration and honorable ambition carried out to
achievement, and by means of his own energy and persistence
he graduated in 1840 from Oberlin College,
became a teacher, and later (for literary work was his
dominant gift) became a regular contributor to the "New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
York Mirror," edited by N. P. Willis, the poet, and the
most brilliant man of letters of his day. Mr. Meeker
wrote both prose and poetry,&mdash;essays, romance, and
verse alike flowing from his facile pen. He is the author
of three books, one of which he dedicated to President
Pierce, and which is in the Boston Public Library among
the choice and rare works not allowed for general circulation
but kept intact for the special use of scholars
and researchers. He became one of the leading writers of
the day on sociology, advancing many ideas which are
to-day maintained by thoughtful students of the questions
involved in this subject.</p>

<p>Founding towns seemed to "run in the family," and
even as his great-grandfather founded the town of
Elizabeth, New Jersey, so Nathan Cook Meeker felt the
impulse to stamp his own strong and progressive individuality
on new communities. He became the secretary
and librarian (in 1844) of the Ohio Trumbull Phalanx, a
colony founded to realize in practical form the theories
of Fourier, and somewhat similar to the famous Brook
Farm experiment. Mr. Meeker also co-operated in founding
the Western Reserve Institute, of which, many years
afterward, Hon. James A. Garfield became president.</p>

<p>About this time he married Arvilla Delight, a daughter
of Levi Smith of Connecticut and a descendant of
Elder Brewster; a woman whose singular force, exaltation,
and beauty of character may be traced through a notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
New England ancestry. The family soon removed to
the Western Reserve in Ohio. Mrs. Meeker had been
known in her sweet girlhood as the beauty of the town.
She was a woman of exceptional refinement and culture;
for many years a teacher, and, more than all, of a spirituality
of character that added to her life its dignity and
grace.</p>

<p>The spell of destiny, the burden always laid upon "The
Beginners," seemed to be on Nathan Cook and Arvilla
Delight Meeker; for no history of the work of the husband
could be written that did not include that of the
wife. Like Nathaniel and Sophia Hawthorne, their lives
were conjoined in that perfect mutual response of spiritual
sympathy which alone makes the mystic marriage a divine
sacrament.</p>

<p>Horace Greeley became interested in Mr. Meeker's work
and invited him to a place on the editorial staff of "The
Tribune," a position which he filled with conspicuous
ability for several years; but in common with all idealists,
Mr. Meeker was haunted and beset by his visions of
a more Utopian future for humanity. A Colorado journal,
recently giving some reminiscences of the life of its
great citizen, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the fall of 1869 Mr. Meeker made a trip to the West
for the 'Tribune,' writing interesting letters by the way.
On his return to New York he was full of the idea of establishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
a colony in Colorado. He mentioned his ambition to
John Russell Young, who talked it over with Mr. Greeley,
and that great man, at the first opportunity, said to the returned
correspondent: 'I understand you wish to lead a
colony to Colorado.' When Mr. Meeker answered 'Yes,'
Greeley added, 'I think it would be a great success. Go
ahead; "The Tribune" will stand by you.'</p>

<p>"With such encouragement Mr. Meeker spent the following
day in writing the article announcing his purpose and
outlining the plan which was afterwards adopted as the constitution
of the colony. Mr. Greeley suggested a few minor
changes, after which the article was printed and kept in type
for a week, in order, as its author said, 'that there might
be due reflection and no haste.' It was published in the
'Tribune' of December 14, 1869, with an editorial indorsement
of the plan and its originator. Nine days later the
colony was organized, and yet in that short time more than
a thousand letters had been received in answer to the
article. On the 15th of the next April the certificate of
organization of 'The Union Colony of Greeley' was filed
for record."</p></blockquote>

<p>In less extended detail some outline of the life of the
founder of Greeley, the "Garden City" of Colorado, has
already been narrated by the writer in a previous book;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
but no adequate reference can be made to the state in
which Mr. Meeker's life and work remains as so remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
a contribution and so fundamental a factor, which
does not present in full the story of his relation to its
development; and the matter is thus presented even at
the risk of some minor repetitions.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1870 Mr. Meeker led his colony to
Colorado. The colonists wished to give the town the name
of its founder, but he himself insisted that it should bear
the name of Greeley, after the great editor of the "Tribune,"
of whose staff he was still a member. Into all
the sacrifice and the hardships of this pioneer life Mrs.
Meeker, a woman gently born and bred, entered with the
utmost heroism. From the very inception the undertaking
was a signal success. But Mr. Meeker conceived of
still another extension of his activities in the problem
then so prominently before the country,&mdash;the civilization
of the Indians. He was appointed agent of the northern
Utes, in possession of the great park region of the Rocky
Mountains, on White River. To it he went in the same
spirit in which General Armstrong entered on his work at
Hampton. He had matured certain theories regarding
the proper treatment of the Indians, in bringing them
within the pale of the civilized arts,&mdash;theories so wise, so
just, so humane, that they might be studied with advantage.
These theories he put to the test. His youngest
daughter, a beautiful and gifted girl, opened a free school
for teaching the Indians. His wife united with him in
every kindly and gracious act by which he strove to win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the confidence of the race. This kindness and gentleness
was unmeasured. The family lived a life of constant sacrifice
and effort for the education and training of the Utes.
But the Indian nature is one that wreaks its revenge,&mdash;not
necessarily on the aggressor, but on the first comer.
Other agents had been lax, and a number of causes of discontent
to which allusion cannot here be made fanned the
smouldering fire. Their chief complaints were that they
were required to work, and to abandon a bit of pasturage,
only a few acres, for the new agency grounds and gardens.
Events drew on like the fates in a Greek tragedy, and on
the morning of September 29, 1879, Mr. Meeker was
cruelly massacred.</p>

<p>The little town of Meeker marks the site of the
Meeker massacre. Here is a little village of a thousand
inhabitants, located on White River, among the most beautiful
of the mountain ranges,&mdash;the location being very
much like that of Florence, in Italy,&mdash;which is the centre
of a very rich agricultural and grazing region. Meeker is
now forty-five miles from a railroad, the nearest station
being Rifle, on the Denver and Rio Grande, a few miles
from Glenwood Springs; but the Moffet road brings to
it railroad connection with Denver. There is an extensive
stage line of over one hundred miles, starting from
Rifle and going on through Meeker up into the mountains,
where the hunting attracts a great number of
travellers, and especially many Englishmen. It is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
this region that President Roosevelt's happy hunting-grounds
lie, and he is a familiar and favorite figure in
Meeker.</p>

<p>There is a little gray-stone Episcopal church among
other churches that adorn this town, which has laid out a
handsome park and which has the perpetual adornment of
the beautiful river that flows through it. The mountains
about supply streams that make irrigation easy, and the
great fields of wheat, potatoes, and alfalfa are fertile and
prosperous. Irrigation makes it everywhere possible to
control the climatic conditions.</p>

<p>Meeker is the county seat of Rio Blanco County, in
which uranium has been discovered in two different
places; and two oil wells, each at a cost of four thousand
dollars, a creamery, costing nearly six thousand dollars,
and water-works at a cost of sixty thousand dollars, have
been established within the past two years. Fifteen reservoirs
and eighty miles of irrigation ditches were constructed
in 1905, and in that year was harvested, in this
county, a quarter of a million bushels of wheat, oats, and
rye.</p>

<p>The basis on which Greeley was founded is thus outlined
in the official documents drawn up by Nathan
Cook Meeker:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I propose to unite with proper persons in the establishment
of a Union colony in Colorado territory. A location
which I have seen is well watered with streams and springs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
there are beautiful pine groves, the soil is rich, the climate
healthful, grass will keep stock the year round, coal and
stone are plentiful, and a well-travelled road runs through
the property."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Meeker proceeded to note the cost of the land,&mdash;eighteen
dollars for every one hundred and sixty acres,&mdash;and
he especially called attention&mdash;for he had the poet's
eye&mdash;to the grandeur of the Rocky Mountain scenery, and
he added:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The persons with whom I would be willing to associate
must be temperance men and ambitious to establish good society,
and among as many as fifty, ten should have as much as
ten thousand dollars each, or twenty should have five thousand
dollars each, while others may have from two hundred
dollars to one thousand dollars and upward. For many to go
so far without means could only result in disaster."</p></blockquote>

<p>The practical wisdom of this clause will be appreciated.
The true idealist is the most practical and wisest of counsellors.
It is only false idealism that leads to destruction.
Mr. Meeker's idea was to make the settlement a village,
with ample building lots, and then to apportion to each
family from forty to one hundred and sixty acres outside
for agriculture.</p>

<p>On such a basis as this the Union Colony of Greeley was
founded. A constitution was adopted that is a model of
the condensation of the duties of good citizenship. Industry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
temperance, education, and religion were the pillars
on which the superstructure was raised. It is little wonder
that the social quality of Greeley to-day&mdash;thirty-six
years after its inauguration as a community&mdash;is of the
highest type and exceptional among all the cities of the
United States.</p>

<p>Irrigation was the first necessity. A canal thirty miles
long was dug, costing sixty thousand dollars. The Cache
la Poudre was first examined and then tapped to furnish
water. The elevation of the surrounding high bluffs secured
the needed descent for the flow of water. The life
began.</p>

<p>Greeley is now a town of some seven thousand inhabitants;
the seat of the State Normal College, which its
president, Dr. Z. X. Snyder, has made one of the great
educational institutions, not only of Colorado, but of the
United States; a college that draws students from almost
every section, even from New England, so able is President
Snyder's course of instruction and so admirable are the
opportunities it affords for subsequent connection with
the fine public school system in Colorado. A position
in any of these offers a higher salary than can be obtained
in the East, to say nothing of many other advantages
associated with the work. Dr. Snyder was one of
the eminent educators of the East; and when some sixteen
years since he accepted his present responsible office,
he brought to it the best traditions of Eastern culture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
and united them with the zeal and freedom and infinite
energy of the West. The Normal campus of forty acres
on high ground, overlooking the town, with President
Snyder's residence in the grounds and other college buildings
near, comprise a beautiful feature of Greeley. The
western view, both from the college and from the home
of President and Mrs. Snyder, over the mountain range
including Long's Peak, is one of almost incomparable
beauty. The faculty of the State Normal comprises thirty
specialists; there is a library of thirty thousand volumes;
the laboratory has the latest scientific equipment
of the day; the art department and the music course are
admirably conducted; French, German, and Italian are
taught according to the latest language methods; and
athletics, domestic science, nature studies, all receive due
recognition. The "Training School" of the State Normal
College has an attendance of nearly five hundred, and
the graduates of this institution begin work on salaries
ranging from five hundred to twenty-five hundred dollars
annually. The tuition is free to all citizens of
Colorado.</p>

<p>The many churches, the excellent public schools, the
clubs and societies for social enjoyment and improvement,
indicate the high quality of life in Greeley. There are
three newspapers; and of these the "Greeley Tribune,"
founded by Mr. Meeker and now under the able editorship
of Mr. C. H. Wolfe, has created for itself more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
a local reputation. Financially, Greeley stands well, with
its several banks and its solidity of resources.</p>

<p>There is hardly a shabby house to be found in all
the town, whether of residence or business. Every building
has a neat and thrifty aspect, and the art of architecture
has been especially studied, for almost without
exception every house, whether large or small, is tasteful
and attractive. A bay window is thrown out here, a little
balcony there, a piazza, a loggia, an oriel window, and the
eye is gratified. But, besides this dainty and tasteful
architecture, the one great feature of Greeley is her beautiful
streets. These are due directly to the taste and
the direction of the founder, Mr. Meeker. The streets
are one hundred feet wide, lined invariably&mdash;every street
in the town&mdash;with a double row of shade trees, giving
coolness, beauty, and contributing much to the modification
of the temperature. Every deed granted in Greeley
forbids the sale of any intoxicating liquor. There is not
a saloon in the place. There is not a loafer or a criminal,
nor are there any poor in the unfortunate sense of
the large cities. No police are needed. The jail is
locally known as a mere ornamental appendage to the
fine forty thousand dollar courthouse.</p>

<p>For many years it has been felt that some expression
should be made in honor of the memory of the founder of
Greeley, and this has now taken form in the project for
the "Meeker Memorial Library," which is in preparation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
The beautiful young city is itself, however, the best memorial
of its noble founder. It is a living monument of
perpetually increasing greatness and beauty; and who
to-day can wander under the shade of the beautiful trees
which in a double row line every street and boulevard&mdash;trees
planted in 1870 under Mr. Meeker's personal
superintendence&mdash;without hearing amid the rustle of
their whispering leaves the poet's words, that fall like a
benediction:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"Be of good cheer, brave spirit; steadfastly</div>
<div class="verse">Serve that low whisper thou hast served; for know,</div>
<div class="verse">God hath a select family of sons</div>
<div class="verse">Now scattered wide thro' earth, and each alone,</div>
<div class="verse">Who are thy spiritual kindred, and each one</div>
<div class="verse">By constant service to that inward law,</div>
<div class="verse">Is weaving the sublime proportions</div>
<div class="verse">Of a true monarch's soul. Beauty and strength,</div>
<div class="verse">The riches of a spotless memory,</div>
<div class="verse">The eloquence of truth, the wisdom got</div>
<div class="verse">By searching of a clear and loving eye</div>
<div class="verse">That seeth as God seeth. These are their gifts,</div>
<div class="verse">And Time, who keeps God's word, brings on the day</div>
<div class="verse">To seal the marriage of these minds with thine,</div>
<div class="verse">Thine everlasting lovers. Ye shall be</div>
<div class="verse">The salt of all the elements, world of the world."</div>
</div></div>

<p>The glamour of romance can never fade from Colorado,
whose entire history is one of heroic deeds and splendid
energy; but the primitive stage of the state is already left
far behind with the nineteenth century. In its intellectual
and scientific development the years of the twentieth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
have almost exceeded its twenty-four years of life as
a state in the nineteenth. The tide of immigration still
continues, but from being the objective point of mining
activities where fortune hunters rushed to find a royal road
to riches, it is now a state of agriculture and of commerce.
Social conditions are thus altered; and though some of
these conditions are those of mining regions, as in the
Cripple Creek district, they have altered from the typical
Bret Harte mining-camp life to those of orderly progress,&mdash;to
the life dominated by twentieth-century ideals of
humanity; the life whose framework is seen in public-school
systems, in religious observance, in the liberal
reading of periodical and other literature, and in the
maintenance of public libraries as a necessity in every
community.</p>

<p>The dawn of literary and artistic development in Colorado
is very evident,&mdash;a dawn that is already of such
radiant promise as to forecast the day when this state shall
contribute to our greatest national literature. A large
number of individual writers could already be named
whose work in books, magazine articles, and excellent
journalism might well be held as typical of the best culture
of the entire country. The first wild turmoil of a
new and richly varied state has given way to a prosperous,
progressive commonwealth. Material progress must still
always precede the higher growth, yet the air is vital with
ideas, and the vision of Colorado is always toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
stars. The beauty and majesty of the environment cannot
but react upon the people. The growth of women's clubs
has been one steady factor of progress, with most favorable
effect on all the general life of intellectual and moral
advancement. The public libraries in every centre establish
and develop the reading habit. While a love for
beauty is an element in human life, the influence of the
transcendent majesty and incomparable sublimity of the
Colorado scenery will continue to prove a source of inspiration
to the mental and moral life of the people. The
changing colors of the mountains are a constant delight.
Colorado offers a perpetual feast of beauty. Her resources
are infinite. Colorado combines all the exaltation of the
untried with an abundance of the conveniences and luxuries
of the older civilization; and of this Centennial State it is
difficult to record facts and statistics that do not seem to
suggest the tales of a thousand nights. With resources
and with scenic loveliness which no language could exaggerate,
it is still only to those who themselves know and
appreciate the grandeur of this state that any interpretation
of it will appear as rather within than as at all
beyond the limits of the most statistical and demonstrable
facts. The East has already outgrown the tradition that
the entire trans-Mississippi region is a howling wilderness.
Colorado is no longer as vague as is Calcutta to the average
mind. Dr. Edward Everett Hale exclaimed that he
desired his sons to know that there was something in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
world besides Beacon Street, and this ambition has of late
years become too prevalent to leave even the extreme
East in any absolute and total ignorance of the wonderful
West. Still it may be true that the flying visions from
Pullman-car windows are marvellously extended and intensified
by increasing familiarity with the almost incredibly
swift progress of this region.</p>

<p>A typical illustration of the fallibility of human judgment
is seen in the attitude taken in 1838 by the great
Daniel Webster on the floor of the United States Senate
against an appropriation for a post route west of the
Missouri River.</p>

<p>"What do we want," said he, "of this vast worthless
area,&mdash;this region of savages and wild beasts, of deserts,
shifting sands, and whirlwinds of dust, of cactus and prairie
dogs? To what use could we ever hope to put these great
deserts, or these endless mountain ranges, impregnable and
covered to their base with eternal snow? What use have
we for such a country? Mr. President, I will never vote
one cent from the public treasury to place the Pacific Coast
one inch nearer Boston than it is to-day."</p>

<p>It is a far cry from this "vast worthless area," as Mr. Webster
termed it in 1838, to the grand and richly promising
state of to-day, with its splendid young cities where art and
science unite with literature and ethics in the rapid development
of social progress; with its mountain ranges climbed
in palace cars; its electric transit and electric lighting; its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
vivid and forceful achievements, that even in each decade
concentrate the progress of a century, as seen in the past.</p>

<p>It is not a mere vagary, but rather a practical and
momentous fact, that Colorado is peculiarly the realm
receptive to invisible potencies and mental impressions.
Science is now confronted with the question as to whether
thought and electricity may be identified as the same force
under different degrees of manifestation. "There is an
elemental essence&mdash;a strange living force&mdash;which surrounds
us on every side, and which is singularly susceptible
to the influence of human thought," says an English scientist,
and he continues: "This essence responds with the
most wonderful delicacy to the faintest action of our minds
or desires; and this being so, it is interesting to note how it
is affected when the human mind formulates a definite
thought or desire." All the significance of a thousand
years may be concentrated in an instant's thought, as
all the heat stored up in all the forests of the world is
concentrated in a small quantity of radium. Emerson
embodies this truth in the stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"His instant thought a poet spoke,</div>
<div class="indent1">And filled the age his fame;</div>
<div class="verse">An inch of ground the lightning strook</div>
<div class="indent1">But lit the sky with flame."</div>
</div>

<p>It is intensity, not duration, that is of consequence, and
that determines results. To state that there is something
in the Colorado air that incites active and lofty thought;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
that uplifts the soul and enables one to discern the practical
processes for identifying the most marvellous scenic
grandeur of the civilized world with the most advanced
processes of applied industries, is to state a simple fact.
Phillips Brooks once said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I know no ideal humanity that is not filled and pervaded
with the superhuman. God in man is not unnatural, but the
absolutely natural. That is what the incarnation makes us
know.... The truths of heaven and the truths of earth are
in perfect sympathy.... The needs of human nature are
supreme, and have a right to the divinest help."</p></blockquote>

<p>The early explorers and pioneers in Colorado felt this
truth, so finely stated by Bishop Brooks, even if they did
not formulate it in words. The apparently insuperable
obstacles of a land where the desert disputed the space
with the Titanic mountain ranges piled against the sky,
incited them to effort rather than paralyzed their energy.
It is fitting that this most ideal state, rich in resources of
almost undreamed-of variety and importance, should present
a significant object lesson in the working out of
the problem involved in the higher civilization of the
twentieth century. The future of Denver, of Pueblo,
Colorado Springs, Greeley, and other important centres,
is a most important part of the future of the nations.
The Star of high destiny shines on the Centennial State.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Mexico</span> is the scene of surprises. Traditionally supposed
to be a country that is as remote as possible from
the accepted canons of polite society; that is also an arid
waste whose temperature exceeds the limits of any well-regulated
thermometer,&mdash;it reveals itself instead as a
region whose temperature is most delightful, whose coloring
of sky and atmosphere is often indescribably beautiful,
and whose inhabitants include their fair proportion
of those who represent the best culture and intelligence of
our country. New Mexico has a mixed population. To
a hundred and sixty thousand Americans there are a hundred
and twenty-five thousand of Spanish or Mexican descent;
a few hundred Chinese and Japanese, and some
thirteen thousand Indians, who are, however, peaceful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
industrious, and a proportion of whom have been educated
in the Government schools for the Indians.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p183.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ACOMA, NEW MEXICO</p>

<p>The altitude of New Mexico seldom falls to less than
five thousand feet, so that the air is cool and exhilarating.
The rock formations partake of the same rich hue that
characterizes those in Colorado and in Arizona, and as the
soil is rich there is a continual play of color. The scenery
is one changeful, picturesque panorama of mountains, rock,
or walled cañons, vast mesas, uncanny buttes, and lava fields
left by some vanished volcanic fires. The ancient Indian
pueblos are still largely inhabited, and strange ruins of unknown
civilizations add their atmosphere of mystery. The
mouldering remains of the old Pecos church and the
strange communistic dwellings in the old Pueblo de Taos;
the ruins of the fortress and the seven circular mounds,
which were the council-chambers and halls for mystic rites
of the prehistoric civilization; and the fabled site of the
ancient Aztec city where tradition says Montezuma was
born,&mdash;all contribute to a unique interest in this "land
of the turquoise sky," as New Mexico is called.</p>

<p>Acoma, the ancient pueblo perched on a perpendicular
precipice four hundred feet high, with its terraced dwellings
of adobe, its gigantic church, its reservoir cut out of
solid rock, and its inhabitants with their strange customs,
is fairly accessible to the traveller from Albuquerque by a
drive of some twenty miles. Mr. Lummis calls it "the
most wonderful pueblo," and "the most remarkable city in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the world," as compared, of course, with other pueblos
and ruined cities. Acoma has a present population of
some four hundred Indians, and its romantic beauty of
location is unparalleled. There are scientists who incline to
believe that the original Acoma was built on the top of
the <i>Mesa Encantada</i>,&mdash;the "Enchanted Mesa,"&mdash;a sheer,
precipitous rock seven hundred feet high which is now
practically unscalable; although Mr. F. W. Hodge, of the
Bureau of Ethnology, achieved this apparently impossible
feat, and found what is, in his convictions, unmistakable
evidence of human habitation, supporting the traditions
regarding this colossal rock. Some mighty cataclasm of
nature swept the approach away; but if ever there were
human habitations on the "Enchanted Mesa," the period
is lost in prehistoric ages.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p184.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE ENCHANTED MESA, NEW MEXICO</p>

<p>The colossal church in Acoma is a striking feature. Its
walls are ten feet in thickness and sixty feet high, and the
church and yard in which it stands consumed forty years
in their construction. It was only reached by rude stairs
cut in the rock. Dim traditions, which are perhaps hardly
more than speculative theory, suggest that these steps of
approach were suddenly swept away by some convulsion of
nature at a time when the men of this prehistoric pueblo
were away hunting, or otherwise engaged in procuring
means of sustenance, and that the women and children
were thus cut off from all supplies and aid and left to
starve. Mr. Lummis has a theory that seems to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
possible, if not probable, that there was a ledge of
neighboring rocks which served as ladders to the <i>Mesa
Encantada</i>, and that these rocks were swept away by some
frightful storm, or some sudden convulsion of nature, during
the absence of the men; and that a new city&mdash;the
present Acoma&mdash;was then built on the lesser rock on
which it now stands. Acoma was old even when Coronado,
in 1540, made his expedition through the country,
from which period the authentic history of New Mexico
begins with the meagre records of the heroic friars and
the memorials of the Spanish conquerors. Laguna, a
pueblo founded in 1699, lies twenty miles from Acoma
on the Santa Fé route, of which it is one of the interesting
features. All these old Spanish missions, which are found
in more or less degrees of preservation in all this chain
of pueblos in the valley of the Rio Grande, contain ancient
paintings and statues of saints. Largely, the paintings
are crude and worthless, but there exist those that
have legitimate claim to art as the work of Spanish artists
not unknown to fame. Among these is the painting of
San José in the mission at Acoma, a painting presented
by Charles II of Spain. This mission was founded by
Friar Ramirez, who dedicated it "To God, to the Roman
Catholic Church, and to St. Joseph,"&mdash;who was the
patron saint of this pueblo.</p>

<p>There is an amusing legend that Laguna, submerged in
all manner of disasters, looked on the prosperity of Acoma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
and ascribed it wholly to the influence of this picture of
the saint before which the people made their daily adorations
and laid their votive offerings. Laguna believed
that San José would invest it with the same felicities
enjoyed by the neighboring city, could they only secure
the portrait, and their urgent plea to borrow it for a time
was granted by Acoma. Their confidence in the saint was
justified; peace and plenty again smiled on Laguna, and
they made their daily devotions before the great picture.
At length, so runs the legend, Acoma reminded Laguna
that a loan was not a gift,&mdash;to be held in perpetual fee,
and demanded its return. The faithless people of Laguna
declared it was their own,&mdash;and the case actually went
into litigation and was tried in Court. Judge Kirby Benedict,
after hearing all the evidence, decided in favor of
Acoma, but the picture had mysteriously disappeared. The
messengers sent from Acoma to bring the sacred treasure
at last discovered it under a tree half-way between the two
pueblos. They instantly recognized that the saint, rejoiced
at the righteous decision, had started on his homeward
journey of his own volition. The last one of the
Franciscan friars to minister in New Mexico was Padre
Mariano de Jesus Lopez, whose work was in Acoma, the
"city in the sky." Of all the cliff-built cities, Acoma
is the most marvellous. Its terraced dwellings seem, as
Mr. Lummis so graphically says, to be "the castles of
giants," for "the lapse of ages has carved the rocks into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
battlements, buttresses, walls, columns, and towers, and
the view from this cloud-swept city is one never to be
forgotten. On this cliff the sand rises and falls like the
billows of the sea."</p>

<p class="caption">LAGUNA, NEW MEXICO, ON THE SANTA FÉ RAILROAD</p>

<p>No latter-day interest of contemporary life, either in
the romantic scenery or the potential development of New
Mexico, can exceed the richness of its prehistoric past
and the marvels of this ancient civilization that yet remain.
Alluding to these wonderful monumental remains, Colonel
Max Frost, of Santa Fé, who knows his territory in every
aspect of its life and its attractions, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Pajarito Cliff-dwellers' Park, the Chaco Cañon, the
Gila Cañon, western Valencia and Socorro counties abound in
cliff and communal buildings, the age of which has puzzled
scientists, but which are older than any other ruins on the
American continent, and probably in the world. The most
accessible cliff-dwellers' region is the Pajarito Park, only one
day's overland trip from Santa Fé or Española, in which
twenty thousand cliff-dwellings and caves are situated within
a comparatively small area. The scenery of this natural park
is superb; 'wonderful' is the only adjective that will do
justice to the caves in the cliffs, high and inaccessible almost
as eagles' nests, but showing many other signs of occupation
besides the peculiar picture writings in the soft volcanic tufa
of which the cliffs are composed. In addition to the cliffs,
there are remains of communal buildings of later occupation,
some of them containing as high as twelve hundred rooms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
There are also burial mounds with remains of ancient pottery.
Along the eastern foot of this steep plateau flows the Rio
Grande and lie the villages of San Ildefonso, Santa Clara, and
San Juan, while to the west rise the stupendous mountain
masses of the Valles, the Cochiti and Jemez ranges, with their
deep forests and cañons, their famous hot springs, their Indian
villages, and their mines. Where else on earth is there so
much of the beautiful in scenery, of romance, of historic
monuments, of prehistoric remains, of the ancient, the unique,
the picturesque, the sublime, to be found as within a radius
of fifty miles of Santa Fé? One day's trip will take the
wanderer from the historic Old Palace and San Miguel Church
in the City of the Holy Faith, over the foothills of the Sangre
de Cristo range, from which rise in full view mountain peaks
almost thirteen thousand feet high, into the picturesque
Tesuque Valley and by the ancient Indian pueblo of Tesuque.
The road winds through sandhills that the air and the rain
have cut into grotesque shapes, huge as Titans and weird as
the rock formations in the Garden of the Gods. Then come
once more fertile fields and the village of Cuymungue, formerly
an Indian pueblo, now a native settlement. Along the
Nambe River, with its grand falls, close by the Indian pueblo
of Nambe to the pueblo of San Ildefonso on the Rio Grande;
then along that river through the laughing Española Valley,
past the Black Mesa, a famous Indian battleground, into the
large Indian pueblo of Santa Clara and its mission church to
Santa Cruz, also with a quaint and ancient church building,
threads the wagon road across the river into Española. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
there the road ascends the wildly beautiful Santa Clara
Cañon, along a rippling trout stream up to the steep cliffs of
the Puye and the Shufinne, with their hundreds and thousands
of prehistoric caves and communal buildings. And all
that in one day's journey overland! If the trip be prolonged
another day or two, the remarkable hot springs at Ojo Caliente
and the hot springs in the deep chasm of the Rio Grande at
Wamsley's, the Indian pueblos of Picuris and Taos, the finest
trout streams and best haunts of wild game, or the Jicarilla
Indian Reservation, as well as busy lumber and mining camps,
can be visited. And that is only in one direction from Santa
Fé! Going south, one day's trip will pass through the quaint
settlements of Agua Fria, Cienega, and Cieneguilla, by the
Tiffany turquoise mines, the old mining camp of Bonanza, the
smelter at Cerrillos, the Ortiz gold placers, worked a hundred
years before gold was discovered in California and still
yielding gold dust and nuggets, the coal mines at Madrid,
where bituminous and anthracite coal have been mined from
the same hillside, the placer and gold mines of Golden and
San Pedro, not to speak of sheep and cattle ranches and the
beautiful scenery of the Cerrillos, Ortiz, San Pedro, and
Sandia mountains.</p>

<p>"Another trip of one day from Santa Fé will take the traveller
by the pueblo ruins of Arroyo Hondo over Apache hill,
the battlegrounds of Apache Springs, the interesting native
settlement of Cañoncito, over Glorieta Pass and the battlefield
of Glorieta, to the upper Pecos River, by the ancient and
historic Pecos church ruins, the village of Pecos, and through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the most beautiful summer-resort country in the Southwest,
where trout streams babble in every cañon and where from
one summit can be surveyed the hoary heads of eleven of the
twelve highest peaks in New Mexico.</p>

<p>"Another day's trip out of Santa Fé will take the visitor
up the rugged Santa Fé Cañon, by the large reservoir and the
Aztec mineral springs to the Scenic Highway, which crosses
the Santa Fé range into the upper Pecos Valley and unfolds
at every step new mountain views and panoramas magnificent
beyond description. Nor do these trips exhaust the interesting
points in and about Santa Fé. Almost every other town
in the territory offers sights and scenes of equal interest to
the tourist and sightseer.</p>

<p>"The prehistoric ruin of the Chaco Cañon and Pueblo
Bonito, in southeastern San Juan County, as well as those at
Aztec, in the same county, are more fully excavated than
those of the Pajarito Park, and in some respects are more
palatial and more impressive. They can best be reached
from Gallup or Thoreau on the Santa Fé Railway in McKinley
County.</p>

<p>"The prehistoric ruins on the Gila Forest Reserve, as well
as those in western Valencia and Socorro counties, have not
been thoroughly explored thus far, being distant from the
highways of travel; but on this very account they should
have a special charm and attraction for the student of
archæology.</p>

<p>"Coming to more recent, although still ancient days, the
ruins of the Gran Quivira and of nearby abandoned pueblo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
villages, between the Jumanes Mesa and the Mal Pais and
Jornado del Muerto, are of great historic interest. They are
best reached from the station of Willard at the junction of
the Santa Fé Central and Eastern Railway of New Mexico.
Similar ruins are found in western Valencia, Socorro, and
other counties, and divide the interest of the tourist with the
many present-day Indian pueblos and Spanish settlements
boasting of considerable antiquity. The Zuñi, Navaho,
Jicarilla, and Mescalero Indian reservations are well worthy
a visit, and upon the first two named are many prehistoric
ruins.</p>

<p class="caption">CLIFF DWELLER RUINS, NEAR SANTA FÉ, NEW MEXICO</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p191b.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">STONE TENT, CLIFF DWELLERS, NEW MEXICO</p>

<p>"Foremost in interest and value in historic archæology
are the old mission churches of the Franciscans. In every
occupied Indian pueblo and at the site of almost every
abandoned pueblo, there is one of the monuments of those
pioneers of Christianity and civilization, the Franciscan
Fathers. Many of these are in a good state of preservation,
while others are in ruins, but every one is an object of
historic interest.</p>

<p>"The old mission church of San Diego, which is the oldest
of the California missions, was founded in 1769. It is almost
a total ruin; only the front remains in a good state of preservation.
The side walls are still standing, but no portions of
the roof or interior remain. This is the most venerable and
venerated historic monument in the state of California, and
is annually visited by thousands of tourists. It has stood for
one hundred and sixty-four years. It marks the beginning
of civilization and Christianity in California. And yet, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
New Mexico, on the upper Pecos, thirty-five miles west of
Las Vegas, at the site of the abandoned Pueblo of Cicuye, are
the ruins of the old Pecos church. The church is
three hundred years old. It was nearly one hundred and
fifty years old when the San Diego mission was founded. It
was projected before the Spanish Armada was destroyed and
antedates the coming of the Mayflower and the settlement
of Jamestown. All that is said of the old Pecos church may
be said of that of Jemez. They were built at the same time.
The one at Gran Quivira was founded in 1630, and is a fairly
well-preserved ruin. The churches at San Ildefonso and Santa
Clara are in a complete state of preservation. They are nine
years older than the oldest of the California ruins. The old
San Miguel mission in Santa Fé has been rebuilt. Its walls
date from 1650, the roof from 1694, or possibly a few years
later. From the old church at Algodones was taken a bell,
cast in Spain in 1356, and at the Cathedral at Santa Fé and
other churches are ancient relics and art treasures of old
Spanish and Italian masters. These are only a few examples
selected at random from the large number of ancient churches
of equally great interest scattered over New Mexico. Inscription
Rock, on the old road to Zuñi, and every one of the
pueblos from Taos on the north to Isleta on the south, and
from the Rio Grande pueblos in the central part to Zuñi in
the west, are worthy of a visit, both for historic and present-day
interest.</p>

<p>"Nor is there any other building in this country to compare
in historic interest with the Old Palace at Santa Fé,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
which has been more to New Mexico than Faneuil Hall to
Massachusetts or Liberty Hall to Pennsylvania, nor is there
any other town in the United States which offers so much of
interest to the tourist as the city of St. Francis d'Assisi."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that in many respects the
archæological interest of New Mexico, its atmosphere,
its historic color, is as distinctive as that of Egypt or of
Greece, Italy, or Spain. When, on December 15, 1905,
the first long-distance telephone in Santa Fé established
communication <i>viva voce</i> with Denver, while within a
radius of fifty miles, ruins of prehistoric civilization
fascinated the tourist,&mdash;surely the remote past and the
latest developments of the present met and mingled after
the fashion of "blue spirits and gray." Very curiously
mixed is the civilization of New Mexico. It can almost
be said to lie in strata, like geologic testimony. The
ancient peoples whose very name is lost,&mdash;shrouded in
antiquity that has closed the chapters and refuses to turn
the pages for the twentieth-century reader; the Indian
population; the Spanish, whose explorers&mdash;Alvar Nuñez,
Cabeza de Vaca, Coronado, Juan de Oñate, and others&mdash;and
whose missionaries, from the ranks of the Franciscan
friars, brought to the savage land the first message
of modern civilization; and the American, which within
almost the past half-century has established itself since
that August day of 1846 when General Kearny floated
the stars and stripes from the "Old Palace" in Santa Fé.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
The American civilization and high enlightenment has
poured itself into this "Land of the Sun King,"&mdash;the
"Land of the Turquoise Sky." For now, as Colonel Frost
has so ably and comprehensively noted, "New Mexico is
strictly up to date in its government, in its hotels, its railroad
accommodations, in the protection the law affords,
in its universities, colleges, public schools, sanitariums,
charitable institutions, its progress, and in its prosperity.
Churches are found in every settlement, newspapers in
every town, together with fine stores, banking institutions,
and every safety, comfort, and luxury that the
centres of civilization of the East afford." If that vivid
and inspiring group of the Muses,&mdash;the muse of History,
of Science, of Philosophy, and others,&mdash;painted by
Puvis de Chavannes to adorn the court of the grand stairway
of rich Siena marble in the Public Library of
Boston,&mdash;an achievement in modern art that alone
would immortalize the great painter of France,&mdash;if
these Muses could visit New Mexico, the specialty of each
would be found. The richly historic past that has left
its various records; the present, that has impressed into
its service every power of science, of engineering, of
architectural construction, of agriculture, and of social
progress, would furnish to each a vast field in its own
especial domain.</p>

<p>A work published in Paris somewhere about the middle
of the nineteenth century, entitled "<i>Memoires Historiques</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
<i>sur La Louisiane</i>,"&mdash;a book that has never been translated,&mdash;gives
an account of a French expedition in New
Mexico in search of a mine of emeralds and their encounter
with the Spanish forces; but although in this engagement
the Spanish troops suffered disaster, the Spanish
civilization still continues, while there is little permanent
trace of the French in New Mexico. It is a curious
fact, however, that the present continues this varied and
strangely assorted grouping of races which characterized
the country in its earliest days.</p>

<p>New Mexico reminds one of Algiers. There is the same
Oriental suggestion of intense coloring, of dazzling brilliancy
of sky, of gleaming pearl, of floating clouds.</p>

<p>There is one feature of this trans-Continental trip
which is of the first importance to the tourist, and this is
the line of artistic and beautiful hotels built after the old
mission design, the architecture felicitously harmonizing
with the landscape,&mdash;those Harvey hotels built in connection
with the Santa Fé stations at principal points, as
at Trinidad, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, and others, all christened
with Spanish names,&mdash;the "Cardenas," the "Castañeda,"
the "Alvarado,"&mdash;all of which are conducted
with a perfection of cuisine and service that is rarely
equalled. The social and the picturesque charm of the
long journey is singularly enhanced by the leisurely stops
made for refreshment; the leaving the long train&mdash;with
its two engines, one at either end&mdash;for the little exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
in fresh air gained by going into the dining-rooms;
being able to procure papers at the news stands, fruit, or
other delicacies, and enjoying the scenery and gaining some
knowledge of the place. In connection with the Alvarado,
at Albuquerque, are two buildings: one that offers
a most interesting museum of Indian archæological and
ethnological collections, and the other showing native
goods from Africa and the Pacific islands. Salesrooms
connected with these enable the traveller to purchase any
souvenir from a trifle, to the costly baskets, richly colored
Navajo blankets, the strange symbolic pottery, or the
objects of religious rites.</p>

<p>A day's delay at Albuquerque enables the traveller to
visit four interesting pueblos,&mdash;Santa Ana, Sandia, Zia,
and Jemez,&mdash;in a day's stage ride between Jemez and
Albuquerque. At all these important stations on the
route the Santa Fé has established free reading-rooms for
its employés, fitted up with every comfort.</p>

<p>New Mexico, while partaking in the general fascination
that invests all the great Southwest, is especially
not only a land of enchantment, but a land of opportunities.
It is a country of untold latent wealth, of uncalculated
resources. There are vast tracts of soil that
are ready for the cultivation they will so bountifully
repay; there are over three hundred mining districts,
few of which are developed. Six million sheep are grazing
upon its thousand hills, which would furnish raw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
material for a large number of woollen mills. The land
is favorable for the culture of the sugar beet, and manufactories
for this product are needed. A local authority
states that "the rubber plant is indigenous and mineral
products are of such extent and variety that industries
that need them for raw material, or incidentally in the
process of manufacture, will find in this part of the
United States a location much more favorable than most
of the Eastern manufacturing centres. There exist large
deposits of iron ore, fluxing material and fuel for furnaces,
steel mills and smelters, and there are but few branches of
manufacture which could not be established with profit
in this part of the Southwest. Besides the raw material
there are offered the water-power, the fuel, the cheap
labor, special inducements, such as exemption from taxation
for the first five years and a low assessment thereafter,
favorable legislation, cheap building sites, railroad
facilities, freedom from excessive competition, the increasing
home demand of a growing commonwealth of vast
resources, and proximity to the markets of Mexico and
the Orient....</p>

<p>"Farmers are urged to come to till the fertile soil
under the most favorable conditions, and with home
markets that pay better prices than can be obtained anywhere
else. Only a quarter of a million of acres are under
cultivation, and most of these only in forage plants or in
products that demand little attention; four times that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
area is immediately available for agricultural purposes.
Not one-half of the flowing water is utilized, and not
one-fiftieth of the flood water is stored. There are undeveloped
possibilities of farming by the Campbell or dry-soil
method. New Mexico raises the finest fruit in the
world, and every other crop that can be produced anywhere
in the temperate zone. Yet it imports annually
millions of dollars' worth of flour, alfalfa, hay, potatoes,
fruit, garden produce, poultry, eggs, butter, cheese, honey,
beef, pork, and other products of the farm and dairy that
it can and should raise at home. Free lands, the finest
climate in the world, irrigation, churches, schools, railroad
facilities, home markets, good prices, and extensive
range, are all factors which help to make the life of the
farmer and stock grower in New Mexico pleasant and
prosperous."</p>

<p>The visitor from the East enters New Mexico through
a long tunnel; and in Raton, a prosperous city of some
eight thousand people located in the Raton Mountains,
is found the centre of an enormous coal belt, and also a
promising oil field. Raton is called the "Gate City." It
exports ice of a very pure quality, the water being from
a reservoir of a capacity of over fifty million gallons. The
streets of Raton are graded and have electric lighting;
there is a fine park, long-distance telephonic connection
with Colorado and New Mexican cities, and its schools
and churches are numerous. A new Raton tunnel is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
in process of construction by the Santa Fé line that will
enter New Mexico through the mountains at a lower
point. The work is being done by electric drills that
offer a most interesting spectacle in their process. The
tunnel will cost a million dollars. Most beautiful is the
landscape and the coloring of air and sky between Raton
and Las Vegas. The Cimarron range is silhouetted against
the western sky; picturesque points on the old Santa Fé
trail are seen; and Mora Cañon, through which the journey
lies, has its romantic attractions. From the lofty
plateau of Raton's Peak the deep, dark valley of Rio Las
Animas Perdidas is disclosed; the matchless Spanish
Peaks, "Las Cumbres Españolas," lift their heads into
the blue sky; Pike's Peak gleams like a monumental
shaft in the clouds, and the Snowy Range, for more than
two hundred miles, is within the luminous landscape.</p>

<p>Las Vegas, the second city in importance in New Mexico,
is a fascinating place. There are really three towns of
Las Vegas&mdash;the old Spanish town, still retaining its ancient
convent and missions; the new, up-to-date Las
Vegas, with its Castañeda Hotel&mdash;beautiful in the old
Moorish architecture, with spacious piazzas and balconies;
and Las Vegas Hot Springs, connected by trolley cars.
Thus there is the particular paradise of the invalid, or of
those who take prevention rather than cure and a sunny
winter in order not to be invalids; for at Las Vegas Hot
Springs, to which a branch railroad of this omnipresent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Santa Fé conveys the traveller&mdash;only six miles&mdash;the
Hot Springs boil and bubble like the witches' caldron.
Here the guests may immerse themselves in boiling
mineral water, or lie all day in the sunshine, or whatever
else they prefer; and the medicinal waters, internally
and externally administered, are said to make one over
altogether. Rheumatic and tubercular affections flee, it
is said, before this treatment and the wonderful air;
and apparently if Ponce de Leon had only chanced upon
Las Vegas he would not have searched in vain for his
fabled fountain.</p>

<p>Albuquerque is an exceedingly "smart" town. Its
residents are almost entirely Eastern capitalists, who are
living here that they may keep an eye on their possessions,
mines, ranches, and the things of this world in
general. However largely they have laid up their treasures
in heaven, they have a goodly amount also on earth,
over which they perhaps keep closer watch and ward than
over their more immaterial possessions. At all events,
Albuquerque is a sort of Newport of the West, where
people drive and dance and dine from one week to another,
and the women are so stylish as to suggest some
occult affinities with the Rue de la Paix.</p>

<p>In this brilliant and thoroughly up-to-date young city
of Albuquerque, the metropolis of New Mexico; in
Las Vegas, one of the fascinating towns of the continent;
in Raton and Gallup, and in its capital, Santa Fé,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the territory has a galaxy of exceedingly interesting
towns.</p>

<p>Albuquerque is the trade centre of a region exceeding
in area all New England. With a population estimated
at some eighteen thousand; the seat of the University of
New Mexico, whose buildings occupy a plateau two hundred
feet above the town, commanding a beautiful view;
with a scenic background of the Sandia and the Jemez
mountains; with the most extensive free Public Library
in the territory; two daily journals and a number of
weekly papers in both Spanish and English, and several
monthly publications; with its splendid railway facilities
both to the North and the South, as well as on the great
trans-continental line from the East to the Pacific; with
the shops of the Santa Fé road employing over seven
hundred men, as the junction point of three lines of this
superb system; and with the beautiful Alvarado hotel,
in the old Spanish mission architecture, from whose wide
piazzas the view comprises a host of mountain peaks
piercing the turquoise sky, and whose beauty and comfort
is a masterpiece of the magician of the Land of Enchantment;
with the Musée of Indian relics and souvenirs of
the Moki, the Navajo, the Zuñi, Pima, and Apache; the
fine Mexican filigree work; the model of an Indian
pueblo, and other curios,&mdash;with all these and many
other interesting aspects, Albuquerque fascinates the
tourist. In the "Commercial Club" it has a unique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
institution representing the combination of business and
social life. The broad streets are well lighted by electricity;
there is electric transit and a fine water system.
Albuquerque has also extensive manufacturing interests,
in foundry, lumber, and other directions, which aggregate
an investment of over two millions of capital with an
annual productive value of more than four millions.</p>

<p>Returning to Las Vegas; with its ten thousand inhabitants,
its large floating population drawn by the medicinal
hot springs, and the seat of the territorial Normal School.
As a noted wool centre, and with its daily papers, good
schools, and many churches, it is another alluring point.
One feature of important interest is the new "Scenic Highway"
that is in process of completion between Las Vegas and
Santa Fé, across the Pecos Forest Reserve, which will offer
some of the grandest views in any of the mountain regions
of the West. It will be to Santa Fé and Las Vegas what
the beautiful drive between Naples, Sorrento, and Amalfi
is to Southern Italy. This scenic road will wind up to the
Dalton Divide, nine thousand five hundred feet high,
where Lake Peak, glittering with snow, Santa Fé Cañon,
and other peaks and precipices and cañons, are all about,
and the Pecos River is seen far below as a thread of silver.
This drive will be one of the famous features of the entire
West when completed. New Mexico monopolizes the
greatest belt of coal deposits west of the Missouri, while
Arizona has the monopoly in pine forests.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>The reclamation work in the southern part of the
Rio Grande Valley is now in successful process, and near
Engle a reservoir forty miles in length will be established,
having a capacity of two million acre-feet. It is estimated
that a hundred and ten thousand acres of land
will thus be put under irrigated agriculture which will
yield marvellous returns in alfalfa, cereals, vegetables,
and fruits.</p>

<p>The government has also purchased the system of the
Pecos Irrigation Company, which is now transferred to
the Reclamation Service of the United States. This is
the largest irrigation scheme in New Mexico. It is located
on the Pecos River, which is fed from springs many
of which gush forth from the earth with such force as to
indicate that their source must be in high, snow-crowned
hills.</p>

<p>New Mexico's railroad facilities may be estimated from
the fact that not a county in the territory is without a
railroad, while many have the benefit of three lines. With
twenty-five hundred miles of railroads within the territorial
limits already in operation, it is confidently expected
that this number will be increased to four thousand miles
within two years, as much of this anticipated increase is
already under construction. Of the present railways eleven
hundred miles belong to the Santa Fé system alone. The
matchless scenery of the Denver and Rio Grande route
between Ontonito and Santa Fé offers the tourist one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the most enjoyable of trips through Española, Caliente,
and other points of beauty with the mountain peaks of
San Antonio, Taos, Ute, and others within the horizon,
often appearing like islands swimming in a faint blue
haze.</p>

<p>There is space and to spare in New Mexico. There
are almost unlimited possibilities, with much to get
and as much to give, and the latter is by no means less
important in life than the former. Out of a total area of
over seventy-eight million acres only about a quarter of a
million are under irrigation agriculture, and the field for
reclamation is as unlimited as it is promising. The land
is fertile and the productions are abundant. The sky is a
dream of color and of luminous beauty, and the climate is
one of the most delightful in the entire world. Nor does
New Mexico suffer from that which is the greatest deprivation
of Arizona,&mdash;the lack of water. There is an abundance
of the mountain flood waters that now go to waste
which would store vast reservoirs; there is the flow of
copious streams and large river systems, and there are
artesian belts of water all ready for mechanical appliances.
The Campbell dry culture, which is increasingly in use in
the eastern part of Colorado, has been successfully introduced
into New Mexico. Fruit-growing is already becoming
an important industry, and the apple orchard, of all
other varieties of horticulture, is the most successful. At
the Paris Exposition in 1900 New Mexico made an exhibit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
of apples, and also at Buffalo in 1901, receiving from
the former the award to rank with those of the best
apple-growing regions in any part of the United States,
and from the latter the first prize. Peaches, pears,
and apricots grow well; the cherry does not thrive in
New Mexico, but grapes are grown with conspicuous
success.</p>

<p>The mineral resources of New Mexico are varied, and
include gold, silver, copper, lead, and other minerals. In
precious stones there is promise of untold development.
The Tiffanys own large turquoise mines, whose supply,
thus far, has proved inexhaustible; and the opal and the
moonstone are found in many places. But it is as an
agricultural commonwealth, and as the repository of vast
coal belts, that New Mexico is chiefly distinguished.</p>

<p>It was early in February, 1880, that the first train
over the Santa Fé railroad entered the territorial capital
and initiated its transformation from the mediæval Spanish
town to that which is, in part, the theatre of the
progressive American life. In Santa Fé one of the landmarks
pointed out to-day to the visitor is the old Santa
Fé Trail, whose story was told so vividly, some years ago,
by Colonel Henry Inman,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who has described the majestic
solitude of this highway and has narrated the mingled experiences
of the early pioneers and the soldiers who thus
marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> through the wilderness. History and romance
mingle in the wonderful past of New Mexico, and it needs
no sibyl of old to proclaim from the <i>Mesa Encantada</i>
the promise of the future to this beautiful Land of the
Turquoise Sky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the place once occupied by those whose lives were consecrated
to the divine ideal, some influence, as potent as it
is unseen, binds the soul to maintain the honor that they
left; to hold the same noble standard of life. The spell
is felt even while it eludes analysis. Few to-day can tread
the narrow, primitive little streets of old Santa Fé without
some consciousness of this mystic influence. It was here,
in the centuries gone from all save memory, that</p>

<p>and "The True City of the Holy Faith of Saint Francis"
(<i>La Ciudad Real de la Santa Fé de San Francisco</i>) is
forever consecrated by the memory of these holy men, and
vital with the tragic interest, the heroic and pathetic story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of their lives. As early as 1539 Friar Marcos de Nizza
and other Fathers of the Church pressed on into this
country&mdash;then an unknown wilderness&mdash;to extend the
domain of the Holy Cross and carry onward "the true
faith of St. Francis." They encountered every hardship
possible to a savage land; sacrifice and martyrdom were
their reward. They left a land of learning and refinement
to carry the light into regions of barbarism. They gave
their lives to teaching and prayer, and they sowed without
reaping their harvest. Yet who shall dare think of their
brilliant, consecrated lives as wasted? for the lesson they
taught of absolute faith in God is the most important in
life. Faith provides the atmosphere through which alone
the divine aid can be manifested, and the divine aid is
sent through and by means of our friends and helpers and
counsellors in the unseen world. It is man's business, his
chief business, now and here, to co-operate with God in
the carrying out of His plans and purposes. It was this
literal and practical faith in divine aid that the Franciscan
Fathers taught in the wilderness through all hardship and
disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>This Spanish mission work planted itself over the entire
vast region which is now known as New Mexico, Arizona,
and Southern California. The friars set out on long,
lonely journeys, wholly without ways and means to reach a
given destination save as they were guided by unseen
hands and companioned by unseen guides. The cloud by
day and the pillar of fire by night led them on. They
went forth to meet desolation and sacrifice and often martyrdom;
yet their gentle zeal and cheerful courage never
failed. They traversed hundreds of miles of desert wastes;
they encountered the cruel treatment of the Apaches and
the Navajos; but these experiences were simply to them
the incidents of the hour, and had no relation to the ultimate
issue of their work. In 1598 the first church was
founded, by a band of ten missionaries who accompanied
Juan de Oñate, the colonizer, and was called the chapel of
San Gabriel de los Españoles, but it was deserted when, in
1605, the city of Santa Fé was founded by Oñate, and in
1630 the church of San Miguel was built. The original
wall was partly destroyed in the rebellion of a half-century
later, but it was restored in 1710, and the new cathedral
was built on the site where the present one now stands.
As early as 1617 there were eleven Spanish mission churches
within the limits of what is now New Mexico,&mdash;at Pecos,
Jemez, and Taos; at Santa Clara, San Felipe, and other
places, mostly within the valley of the Rio Grande. In
six of the historic "seven cities of Cibola," all Zuñi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
towns, these missions were established; and in the ancient
pueblo of San Antonio de Senecú, Antonio de Arteaga
founded a church in 1629; in Picuries, in 1632, Friar
Ascencion de Zárate established the mission, and in 1635
one also in Isleta. In passing Glorieta, from the train
windows, to-day, can be seen the ruins of the early
mission church established there. Before the close of the
seventeenth century the churches in Acoma, Alameda,
Santa Cruz, Cuaray, and Tabirá had been founded, the
ruins of all of which are still standing. These Franciscan
Fathers penetrated the desert and made their habitations
in solitary wastes so desolate that no colonizers
would follow; but to the Indians they preached and
taught them the elements of civilized life.</p>

<p>"Not the wildest conceptions of the mission founders
could have foreseen the results of their California enterprises,"
says Professor George Wharton James in his interesting
work on these old missions.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "To see the land
they found in the possession of thousands of savages converted
in one short century, to the home of tens of thousands
of happy, contented people, would have been a
wild vision indeed. God surely does work mysteriously,
marvellously, His wonders to perform."</p>

<p>Santa Fé is the centre of the archdiocese whose other
diocesean cities are Denver and Tucson. The archbishop,
the Most Reverend J. B. Salpointe, D.D., whose presence
exalts the city of his residence, is one who follows reverently
in the footsteps of Him whose kingdom on earth
the early Franciscans labored to establish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>In 1708 San Miguel was restored by Governor José
Chacon Medina Salazar y Villaseñor, Marqués de Peñuela,
and two years later these restorations were completed. An
inscription that can be traced to-day on the gallery bears
this legend:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p211.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">SAN MIGUEL CHURCH, SANTA FÉ</p>

<p>Not only is this "City of the Holy Faith" consecrated
by that sacrificial devotion of the Franciscan Fathers; the
heroic explorers and pioneers, the brave and dauntless
soldiers, from the time of Cabeza de Vaca and Coronado to
that of the gallant and noble General Kearny, have left
on Santa Fé the impress of their brave purpose and high
endeavor. The old Cathedral of San Francisco, the ancient
church of San Miguel, and the Rosario Chapel, all interest
the stranger. In 1692 Diego de Vargas marched up from
the south with two hundred men and looked sadly at the
little town of Santa Fé, from which his countrymen had
been driven. It would seem that de Vargas was a romantic
figure of his time. He was evidently endowed with
the characteristic vehemence of temperament, intense
energy, and the genius for effective action that marked
the Spanish pioneers. He was rich in resources and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
manifested a power of swift decision regarding all the
perplexities into which his adventurous life led, ever
beckoning him on. The little town he had entered appealed
to him in its impressive beauty. Surrounded with
majestic mountains, with their deep and mysterious cañons,
it was then, as now, a region of entrancing sublimity.</p>

<p>Adjoining San Miguel is the old house where Coronado
is said to have lodged in 1540. The "Old Palace," always
used by the Governors of New Mexico, is partly given over
to a museum of Indian and Mexican curiosities. There
is a little library, open only every other afternoon; there
are many mountain peaks around, which are not difficult
to climb, and which offer charming views. The new
State House is a fine modern building, and Governor
Hagerman, formerly an attaché of the American Embassy
at St. Petersburg, is alert and progressive in his methods.</p>

<p>More than half the residents of Santa Fé speak no English,
and these Spanish and Mexican residents have their
papers in their own language, their separate schools, and
their worship in the old Cathedral. In the early afternoon
women in black, with black mantillas over their heads, are
seen passing up San Francisco Street and entering the Cathedral,
where they fall on their knees and tell their beads
in the silent church. Often one may see in the streets a
funeral procession. The casket is carried in a cart, and
the family sit around it, on the bottom of the wagon.
A few friends follow on foot, and thus the pathetic and
grotesque little procession winds on its way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>The history lying in the dim background of this ancient
Spanish city is one that impresses the imagination. It is
a part of all that wonderful early exploration by the
Spanish pioneers of the vast region of country that is now
known as Arizona and New Mexico.</p>

<p>In 1538 Cabeza de Vaca, after following the disastrous
expedition of Pánfilo de Narvaez to Florida, set forth
with four men to penetrate the vast unknown wastes to
the west, and without compass or provisions they made
their way, crossing the Mississippi two years before its discovery
by De Soto, reached the Moqui country, and finally
arrived in Sinolao with glowing tales that excited the enterprise
of the Spanish conquerors and led to the founding
of another expedition authorized by the viceroy, Mendoza.
It fared forth under the leadership of Padre Marcos de
Nizza, who (in 1539) entered the country of the Pimas,
passed up the valley of the Santa Ana, and set up the
cross, giving the country the name of the New Kingdom
of San Francisco.</p>

<p>Padre de Nizza's men were all massacred by the Moquis,
but he returned, as if bearing a charmed life, and set all
New Spain aflame with his tales of gold and of glory, and
the great opportunity to extend the work of the Holy
Cross.</p>

<p>Mendoza then proceeded to organize two other expeditions,
one under the intrepid Vasquez de Coronado and the
other under Fernando Alarçon. Coronado visited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
ruins of Casa Grande and at last reached the "Seven
Cities," but their fabled wealth had shrunk to the sordid
actualities of insignificant huts, and Coronado returned
to New Spain in 1542, disappointed and dejected.</p>

<p>In the meantime the expedition of Alarçon had sailed
up the Gulf of California (then known as the Sea of Cortez),
and he discovered the Colorado and the Gila rivers,
ascending the Colorado in boats up to the foot of the Grand
Cañon. Then for nearly half a century no further efforts
to explore this region were made. But it is interesting to
note that some eighty years before the landing of the Pilgrims
a Spanish expedition had penetrated into the country
which is now Arizona, and have left definite record of
their discoveries.</p>

<p>In 1582 Antonio de Espejio explored the pueblos of
the Zuñi and Moqui tribes, visiting seventy-four in all,
and discovering a mountain rich in silver ore. From this
time New Mexico was under the rule of the Spanish
conquerors.</p>

<p>Juan de Oñate, who married Isabel, a daughter of Cortez
and a great-granddaughter of Montezuma, assumed
the leadership, and about 1605 the town of Santa Fé
was founded, and within the succeeding decade the Mission
Fathers had built a dozen churches and their converts
composed over fourteen thousand. A prominent padre in
this movement was Eusebio Francisco Kino.</p>

<p>Santa Fé has the distinction of being the oldest town in
the United States, having been established fifteen years
before the landing of the Pilgrims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>The mission church of San Xavier del Bac was established
at so early a date that it was in ruins in 1768, and
on its site was built the present one, in the valley of Santa
Cruz, some ten miles south of Tucson. This mission is a
rare mingling of Ionic and Byzantine architecture, with
a dome, two minarets, and castellated exterior. The front
bears the coat-of-arms of the Franciscan monks&mdash;a cross
with a coil of rope and two arms below&mdash;one of Cohant
and the other of St. Francis d'Assisi. There are four
fresco paintings, and there are more than fifty pieces of
sculpture around the high altar.</p>

<p class="caption">CLIFF DWELLERS. WITHIN TWENTY-FIVE MILES OF
SANTA FÉ, NEW MEXICO</p>

<p>The missions of Guevara, Zumacacori, and San Xavier
were peculiarly fruitful in good results. The ruins of
Zumacacori still cover a large space. The church is partially
unroofed; the form is seen to have been that of a
plain Greek cross with a basilica, and a roofless chapel is
standing. The basilica is still crowned by the cross, and
the vital influence of this sign and seal of faith in the
Christ, this commemoration of the sacrificial zeal that animated
the Mission Fathers is still felt by all who gaze upon
this sacred emblem silhouetted against a blue sky.</p>

<p>Santa Fé is, indeed, alive with the most profound and
arresting interest. The work of the early Spanish missionary
priests effected a great work among the Indians
in creating conditions of peace and industry; for faith in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
God, taught in any form, is not merely nor even mostly
an attitude of spirit: it is the instinctive action of life.
It permeates every motive inspiring it with power; it
vitalizes every effort with creative energy. Faith in God
may well be described as the highest possible form of potency.
He who is receptive to the Divine Spirit moves
onward like a ship whose sails are set to the favoring winds.
He who is unreceptive to the Divine Spirit is like the ship
before the wind with all her sails furled. "The merit of
power for moral victory on the earth," said Phillips Brooks,
"is not man and is not God. It is God and man, not
two, but one, not meeting accidentally, not running together
in emergencies only to separate again when the
emergency is over; it is God and man belonging essentially
together,&mdash;God filling man, man opening his life by faith
to be a part of God's, as the gulf opens itself and is part
of the great ocean."</p>

<p>The unfaltering devotion of the Franciscan Fathers to
the work of bringing civilization and Christianity to these
Indian pueblos and their martyrdom in their efforts to establish
"the true faith of St. Francis" invests Santa Fé
with an atmosphere of holy tradition.</p>

<p>These early Church Fathers taught a pure and high

the Indian language in sufficient measure to speak to the

history, and geography&mdash;in the imperfect way then known;

<p>Three Spanish documents still exist in the territorial
records of New Mexico dated 1693-1694, which give a full
account of the Spanish conquest; of the re-conquest by
the Indians, and the final conquest again by the Spaniards.
There is ample evidence that a city existed on the present
site of Santa Fé four hundred years before the settlement
at St. Augustine. The final Spanish conquest took place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
in 1692, but all the records prior to 1680 were unfortunately
destroyed in the Pueblo Rebellion. New Mexico's
historian, Hon. L. Bradford Prince, who has more than once
served as Governor of the territory and who is one of the
most distinguished men of the West, has finely said that
the people of his territory, although threefold in origin
and language (Spanish, Mexican, and American), are one
in nationality, purpose, and destiny. In Governor Prince's
history of New Mexico he notes its three determining
epochs,&mdash;the Pueblo, the Spanish, and the American,&mdash;and
he refers to it as "an isolated, unique civilization in
the midst of encircling deserts and nomadic tribes."</p>

<p>On August 18, 1846, General Stephen W. Kearny took
possession of the capital of New Mexico in the name of
the United States; and on that date, for the first time,
the national colors floated from the Old Palace and the
acting Spanish Governor, Don Juan Baptista Vigil y
Alvarid resigned his authority.</p>

<p>On the historic plaza where now a memorial to this
brave officer stands, placed there by the "Daughters of
the Revolution," General Kearny proclaimed the peaceful
annexation of the territory of the United States.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We come as friends to make you a part of the representative
government," he said. "In our government all men
are equal. Every man has a right to serve God according to
his conscience and his heart."</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>General Kearny assured the people of the protection
of every civil and religious right, and this forcible and
noble speech&mdash;so characteristically representing the generous
and noble spirit of one of the ablest among the leaders
and the heroes of the nineteenth century&mdash;made a
profound impression on the minds of all who listened to
the words. When on August 18 of 1946 New Mexico
shall celebrate her centenary of union with the United
States, this memorable address of General Kearny's should
be read to the assembled populace. Not even Lincoln's
noble speech at Gettysburg exceeds in simple eloquence
and magnanimity the lofty words of General Kearny.
They were worthy to be spoken in "The City of the
Holy Faith."</p>

<p>It was thus that New Mexico entered the United States,
<i>Esto Perpetua</i>. To-day, after a territorial novitiate of
more than sixty years, she is ardently urging her claim
for statehood.</p>

<p>In old Santa Fé the past and the present meet. Governor
Hagerman receives his guests in the same room in
the Old Palace that was used by the first viceroy; and
seventy-six Spanish and Mexican and eighteen American
rulers have preceded him, among whom was General Lew.
Wallace, who, while serving as territorial Governor, wrote
his immortal "Ben Hur" in one room of the palace,
which is still pointed out to the visitor. During this
period Mrs. Wallace wrote many interesting articles on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the history, the life, and the resources of the territory, in
which are embalmed valuable information delightfully
recorded. Mrs. Prince, the wife of ex-Governor Prince,
a lady distinguished throughout all the country for her
gracious sweetness and refined dignity of manner, is much
interested in the New Mexico Historical Association; and
the ex-Governor and Mrs. Prince, His Honor, Mayor
Cotrell, and Mrs. Cotrell, Colonel and Mrs. Max Frost,
and others of the choice society of Santa Fé, are preserving
the history of this territory "that has survived
all those strange modulations by which a Spanish province
has become a territory of the Union bordering
on statehood." Santa Fé is the home of some of the
ablest lawyers in the United States, and one private
law library is said to be the largest legal library west of
Chicago.</p>

<p>The Old Palace has been identified with the times of
the Inquisition; with the zealous work of Friar Marcos de
Nizza, Friar Augustino Ruiz, and with Coronado and his
band of warriors. On the Plaza, Juan de Oñate unfurled
the banner of Spain; here de Vargas gave thanks for his
victory, and here to-day is a simple monumental memorial
of General Kearny placed there by the Daughters of the
Revolution. The revered memory of Archbishop Lamy is
closely associated with the place. In the Old Palace is a
musée where a great array of unique curios is gathered;
pictures of saints rudely painted on skins; crucifixes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
rudely carved in wood or moulded in native silver; gods
carved in stone, and primitive domestic utensils.</p>

<p>There is a very charming and cultivated society in
Santa Fé of the small circle of American residents,&mdash;a
circle that is of late rapidly increasing. The country
around is rich in gems,&mdash;the turquoise, opal, onyx, garnet,
and bloodstone being found in liberal deposits; and in the
town is a manufactory of Mexican filigree work that
employs the natives only who are very skilful in this delicate
art. The Plaza is a curiously fascinating place to
saunter around, and the visitor finds himself loitering and
lingering as he is wont to loiter and linger on the old
Ponte Vecchio in Florence. The nomenclature of Santa
Fé is sufficiently foreign to enable one to fancy himself
in Andalusia, as such names as Padilla, Quintona, Lopez,
Gutierrez, Vaca, and others recur.</p>

<p>The Rosario Chapel, built by Señor Diego de Vargas,
stands on a height overlooking Santa Fé a mile distant
from the Plaza and the Old Palace. Near it is
now located the Ramona School for the children of the
Apaches. The legend of the founding of San Rosario is
still on the air. When, in 1692, Señor de Vargas, marching
from the south with his band of two hundred men, gazed
upon the city from which, in 1680, his compatriots had
been so tragically driven, he prostrated himself on the
ground and implored in prayer the protection and aid of
"Our Lady of the Rosary," and recorded his purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
that, would she but lead him on to victory, he would
build, on the very site where he was kneeling, a chapel to
her name. Arising, he led his band on to assault, and
after a tragic struggle of eleven hours' duration he was
victorious. Did the "Lady of the Rosary" shield and
strengthen him? Who shall venture to deny it?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"More things are wrought by prayer</div>
<div class="verse">Than this world dreams of."</div>
</div></div>

<p>De Vargas had promised that, in case the victory was
granted to him, he would have the statue of the Virgin
carried from the cathedral to the Rosario Chapel, as
already noted. To this day the custom is fulfilled; and
each year, on the Sunday following <i>Corpus Christi</i>, this
sacred drama is enacted, with sometimes two thousand
people, drawn from all the country around, forming the
procession. The statue is kept in the chapel a week, with
solemn masses celebrated every morning, after which it is
returned to the cathedral and the chapel is closed, not to
be opened again until the octave of the Feast of <i>Corpus
Christi</i> the next year.</p>

<p>The "City of the Holy Faith" is very quiet in these
days, and one finds little trace of the turbulent past when
it was the storm centre of tragic wars and revolutions.
The incessant warfare between the Spaniards and the
Indians, the sublime courage and devotion of Bishop
Lamy and other Fathers of the Church, constitute a wonderful
chapter in the history of our country.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>Santa Fé antedates the landing of the Pilgrims by more
than twenty years. Its history is an unbroken record of
thrilling and romantic events, from its capture by the
Pueblos in 1680; the terrible massacre of the Mission
Fathers, and the flight of the Governor to El Paso; its
conquest again by de Vargas in 1692; the change from
Spanish to Mexican rule; then the splendid entrance of
General Kearny and his troops (in the summer of 1846)
in the name of the United States, down to the scenes and
the incidents of the old Santa Fé Trail and thence to the
present day, when three railroads have brought the city
into close touch with the modern life of which it still
refuses to become a part. Still, Santa Fé has nine mails a
day, a free-delivery postal system, electric lights, and local
and long-distance telephonic connection. The Capitol,
where Governor Hagerman presides over the councils of
state, is a fine modern building with a beautiful view from
the dome. There is a new Federal Building of stone in
classic design, in front of which is placed a monument to
Kit Carson. St. Michael's College, the residence of the
Archbishop, and the Government Indian School attract
the eye. But it is the old Santa Fé of haunting historic
memories that one dreams of in the narrow streets, or in
looking down on the town from a mountain-side. The
quaint little Plaza dreams in the sunshine, which lingers,
as if with a <i>Benedicite</i>, on the Kearny memorial, while
through the unshuttered and uncurtained windows of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
Old Palace, forming one side of the Plaza, the antique
débris may be dimly seen. Should the ghost of any
of the old Spanish warriors peer forth, the apparition
would hardly produce a ripple of surprise. The long
colonnade may be the favorite promenade of phantoms
for aught one knows,&mdash;phantoms, that come and go,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"With feet that make no sound upon the floor."</p>

<p>The twentieth-century sunshine lights up the dusky
corners wherein are stored the relics of the Spanish
conquerors and the followers of St. Francis. Perchance
Francis d'Assisi himself, "revisiting the glimpses of the
moon," glides along the shadows, drawn to the spot where,
at so fearful a cost of life and treasure, his "holy faith" was
guarded; or it may be the warrior in his armor who
for an instant is dimly discerned through the dust-covered
windows. Coronado, too, may haunt this scene.
Many are those in the historic ranks who have contributed
to the making of Santa Fé. It is the most composite
city in American history. The very air is vocal with
tradition and legend.</p>

<p>The little shops around the Plaza bear their signs
mostly in Spanish. Yet mingling with these is the office
of Mr. Lutz of the Santa Fé transcontinental line, with
which the New Mexican capital is connected by a branch
to Lamy, on the main line, where one may stand and
converse with Denver,&mdash;a feat which may surprise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
ghost of Coronado or of Juan de Oñate were it looking
on; and Colonel Frost's daily journal, with its news of
the world, is just at the corner. Not far away, too, is
Mr. Linney, who represents the United States Signal
Service, and regards Santa Fé as a most opportune town
in which to pursue his most up-to-date study of atmospheric
phenomena.</p>

<p>A remarkable personality in Santa Fé is Colonel Max
Frost, the editor of "The New Mexican," the political
leader of the Republican party and a man who, though
blind and paralyzed, is simply a living encyclopædia of
historic and contemporary events. At eight o'clock every
morning Colonel Frost is in his office, at his desk, dictating
to three expert stenographers, carrying on three
different subjects simultaneously. Instead of his blindness
being a hindrance to his work, he has, by the sheer
force of his remarkable energy, transformed the obstacle
into a stepping-stone. "I can do more work in ten
minutes than most men can in an hour," he said, in
reply to a question, "as, being blind, I have nothing to
distract my attention. I put my mind on my work and
keep it there."</p>

<p>Colonel Frost's experience is the most convincing testimony
to the phenomenal power that lies in mental
concentration. He cannot move without assistance,&mdash;physically
he is a wreck; yet he dictates columns of work
daily; he is the most influential leader of the political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
party, and he is one of the makers of New Mexico.
Every line of copy in his daily paper is read to him
before it goes to press, and the vigorous and brilliant
editorial page is largely his own work. For four hours,
every evening, Mrs. Frost reads to him from the great
Eastern dailies, the periodicals, and new books. It is said
in New Mexico that Colonel Frost has been the power
behind the throne in territorial legislation since the time
that General Lew. Wallace served as chief executive in
1879.</p>

<p>Colonel Frost went to Santa Fé from Washington in
1876 as a brilliant young officer, commissioned to build
a military telegraph line from Santa Fé to Ph&oelig;nix, Arizona,&mdash;a
distance of five hundred miles. This commission
attracted great attention, and Colonel Frost became
at once a power among the Spanish-American citizens of
the territory. His great ability was widely recognized
by leading men all over the Southwest. He was urged
to remain and become a citizen of Santa Fé. As if to
further prepare him for his remarkable life, he was commissioned
by the government to serve at several points in
New Mexico on a variety of important matters, and he
thus became singularly identified with the general progress
of the country.</p>

<p>With all his extraordinary work in conducting his paper
and devoting himself to party political measures, Colonel
Frost is serving his territory as Secretary of the Bureau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of Immigration with the most conspicuous ability. Under
his electric touch and irresistible energy there is constantly
prepared and sent out some of the finest transcriptions
of the entire status of the country, in climate, resources,
and opportunities; in achievements already realized and
in the potential developments of the future. Thousands
of residents have been drawn to New Mexico through
the data so ably set forth by Colonel Frost, the matter
being, each year, revised to date. He knows, from personal
observation and intimate contact, every part of the
territory; he is personally acquainted with all the leading
people; and no visitor in the territory can feel his trip in
any sense complete without meeting Colonel Max Frost.
If every state and territory in the Far West could command
such efficient service in the literature of immigration
as is rendered by Colonel Frost, there would be an
appreciable increase of their settlers.</p>

<p>There are many eminent men in Santa Fé,&mdash;government
officers, political leaders, gifted lawyers,&mdash;whom the stranger
within the gates must recognize as among the ablest
leaders and makers of the nation. A newspaper recently
established, "The Eagle," ably edited by Mr. A. J.
Loomis, adds another attraction and source of inspiration
to the wonderful old city, whose life still continues to
illustrate and exalt the "Holy Faith of St. Francis."</p>

<p class="caption">PETRIFIED GIANTS, THIRD FOREST, ARIZONA</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arizona</span> is the Land of Magic and of Mystery. It is the
land of the yet undreamed-of future, and it is also the region
of brooding mystery, of strange surprise. Besides its stupendous
Grand Cañon, here are the cañons of Chiquito,
Marble, Desolation, and Limestone; the Montezuma Well,
Castle Dome, the Four Peaks&mdash;rising to the height of
several thousand feet, for hundreds of miles; the Thumb
Buttes, San Francisco Peak, the Tonto Basin, and the Twin
Lake&mdash;all of these phenomenal marvels of scenery telling
their tale of the action of water and of fire thousands of
ages ago; convulsions of nature which have rent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
mountains asunder, opened chasms thousands of feet deep
in the earth, and projected the bottom of a sea into the
air as a mountain peak,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"What time the gods kept carnival."</p>

<p>The gods have, indeed, kept high carnival in Arizona.
Every aspect of nature is on a scale of Titanic magnificence.
The cañon systems of its mountain ranges; the indescribable
grandeur which reaches its supreme majesty in
the Grand Cañon; the wonders of extinct volcanic action;
the colossal channels cut by rushing waters; the unearthly
splendor of the atmospheric effects, and the coloring of
the skies,&mdash;all combine to render Arizona an expression of
magical wonder. All manner of phenomenal conditions
are encountered. The land is a red sandy desert, whose
leading productions are loose stones (lying so thickly in
the sand as to make walking or driving all but impossible)
and pine trees, petrified forests, and cacti. The
riotous growth of the cactus is, indeed, a terror to the
unwary. But it is in sunsets and enchantment of views
and richness of mines, and in marvellous curiosities&mdash;as
the Petrified Forest, Meteorite Mountain, and the Grand
Cañon&mdash;that Arizona distinguishes herself. She cannot
irrigate her soil because there is no available water. But
the pine forests&mdash;some of them&mdash;produce lumber; the
mines are rich, and the features of nature unequalled in
the entire world; while the exhilaration of the electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
air and the wonderful beauty of coloring quite make
up to Arizona resources that are unsurpassed if not
unrivalled.</p>

<p>Arizona is not an agricultural country by nature, nor
hardly by grace. The resources are mining and timber.
Still there are probably some twenty million acres capable
of rich productiveness, on which wheat, barley, corn, vegetables
of all kinds, and also rice and cotton, could be successfully
cultivated if irrigation could be sufficiently effected.
The largest area of agricultural land lies in the regions
adjacent to Prescott and Ph&oelig;nix. This Salt River Valley
is rich in alluvial soil. The Gila Valley also offers, though
in lesser area, the same fertile land, and the valleys of the
Colorado, Chiquito, of Pueblo Viejo, the Santa Cruz, the
San Pedro, the Sulphur Springs, and the great mesa
between Florence and Ph&oelig;nix, offer the same possibilities.
The great problem of Arizona is that of irrigation, as most
of the rivers lie at the bottom of inaccessible cañons and
present difficulties of access which no engineer can as yet
clearly see a way to overcome. The conditions are, however,
materially assisted by the rainy seasons, occurring
usually in February or March and in July or August,
when water can be stored. The rain itself is as peculiar
in Arizona as are other conditions of this wonderland.
It rains in sections; it may rain in torrents in a man's
front yard while the sun shines in his back yard; or if
this statement has something of the flavor of "travellers'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
tales, it is at least typical of actual facts. Five minutes'
walking is often all that is required to carry one into, or
out of, a severe downpour of rain. The clouds follow the
mountain spurs as invariably as a needle follows the magnet
and a torrent may fall on the mountains above, flashing
down in a hundred improvised raging cataracts and waterfalls,
while in the valley below the sun shines out of the
bluest of skies. No panoramic pictures of the stage ever
equalled the pictorial effects of a thunderstorm in the
mountains, when the forked lightning leaps from peak to
peak in a blaze, through the air; when it dashes like a
meteoric shower from rock to crag, and the thunder reverberates
with the mighty roar of a thousand oceans beating
their surf on the shore.</p>

<p>In Maricopa County, in the Salt River Valley, new and
important conditions have been initiated by the government
system of irrigation which has transformed arid lands
into fertile gardens. The government has expended three
million dollars in constructing the Salt River dam (sixty
miles north of Ph&oelig;nix), which is the largest artificial lake
in the world. This reservoir will store one and a half
million acres-feet of water, drawing it from the mountain
cañons miles away. Not only does this project mean an
abundant water supply for a region heretofore useless, but
rich returns as well.</p>

<p>There are few regions which so attract and reward the
researches of the scientist as does Arizona. The geologist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
the mineralogist, the ethnologist, the archæologist, finds
here the most amazing field for apparently unending
investigation and study. Nor is the botanist excluded.
The flora of Arizona offers the same strange and unique
developments that characterize the region in so many
other directions. The cacti flourish in riotous growth.
The saguaro, a giant species, frequently attains a height
of forty feet. A strange spectacle it is, with its pale green
body, fluted like a Corinthian column, and its colossal
arms outstretched, covered with immense prickly thorns
and bearing purple blossoms. The century plant flourishes
in Arizona. There is a curious scarlet flower, blooming
in clusters, at the top of straight pole-like stumps ten
to fifteen feet in height, which terminate in luxuriant
masses of scarlet blossoms and green leaves, and grow in
groups of from a dozen to fifty together, producing the
most fascinating color effects in the landscape. This
plant is called the ocotilla. There are plants which produce
a fibrous textile leaf which the native Mexicans used
as paper; there are others whose roots are used as a substitute
for soap. The trees are largely pine, cedar, and
juniper, though in many parts of the state the rolling
foothills bear forests of oak, and the sycamore, ash, elder,
walnut, and the swift-growing cottonwood are found along
the watercourses.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p232.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">COLLECTION OF CACTI MADE BY OFFICERS AT FORT
McDOWELL, ARIZONA, FOR THIS PICTURE</p>

<p>"The echinocactus, or bisnaga, is also called 'The Well
of the Desert,'" says Dr. Joseph A. Munk in some interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>sketches of Arizona.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "It has a large barrel-shaped
body, which is covered with long spikes that are curved
like fishhooks. It is full of sap that is sometimes used to
quench thirst. By cutting off the top and scooping out
a hollow, the cup-shaped hole soon fills with a sap that
is not exactly nectar, but can be drunk in an emergency.
Men who have been in danger of perishing from thirst on
the desert have sometimes been saved by this unique
method of well-digging."</p>

<p>Of the palo verde Dr. Munk notes that it is "a true
child of the desert," and he adds:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No matter how hot and dry the weather, the palo verde
is always green and flourishing. At a distance it resembles
a weeping willow tree stripped of its leaves. Its numerous
long, slender, drooping branches gracefully crisscross
and interlace in an intricate figure of filigree work. It has
no commercial value, but if it could be successfully transplanted
and transported it would make a desirable addition
to greenhouse collections in the higher latitudes.</p>

<p>"The romantic mistletoe, that is world-renowned for its
magic influence in love affairs, grows to perfection in Southern
Arizona. There are several varieties of this parasitic
plant that are very unlike in appearance. Each kind partakes
more or less of the characteristics of the tree upon
which it grows, but all have the glossy leaf and waxen
berry."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>The grasses of Arizona, are, in some places, very beautiful,
of a rich velvety green; and the infinite varieties of
wild clover, the gramma, the buffalo, the sacatone, and
other grasses, are richly nutritive and offer good facilities
for grazing. As a wool-producing country Arizona has no
rival, the climate giving the best of protection to sheep
with the minimum of care, and the grazing offering adequate
means of support; and stock raising of all kinds, indeed,
is destined to become a great industry in Southern
Arizona.</p>

<p>The climate of Arizona can only be alluded to in the
plural, as in the expressive phrase of one of Mr. George
W. Cable's creole characters, "dose climates," for Arizona
has all the climates of the known world. The range of
choice almost exceeds the range of the Fahrenheit registration.
From the mountain summit, covered with snow
for at least ten months out of the year, to the heat in
Yuma, which has scored up to one hundred and twenty-eight
degrees or more, there are all varieties and every
conceivable quality of atmosphere. In the main, however,
the climate of Arizona is inexpressibly delightful.</p>

<p>Dr. Munk, who is one of the distinguished physicians
in Los Angeles, has made a study of Arizona as a health
resort, and of its conditions he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The atmosphere of Arizona is not only dry, but also very
electrical; so much so, indeed, that at times it becomes almost
painful. Whenever the experiment is tried, sparks can
be produced by friction or the handling of metal, hair, or wool.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
It affects animals as well as man, and literally causes 'the
hair to stand on end.' The writer has on various occasions
seen a string of horses standing close together at a watering-trough,
drinking, so full of electricity that their manes and
tails were spread out and floated in the air, and the long hairs
drawn by magnetic attraction from one animal to the other
all down the line in a spontaneous effort to complete a circuit.
There are times when the free electricity in the air is so
abundant that every object becomes charged with the fluid,
and it cannot escape fast enough or find 'a way out' by
any adequate conductor. The effect of such an excess of
electricity is decidedly unpleasant on the nerves, and causes
annoying irritability and nervousness.</p>

<p>"The hot sun sometimes blisters the skin and burns the
complexion to a rich nut-brown color, but the air always
feels soft and balmy, and usually blows only in gentle zephyrs.
The air has a pungent fragrance which is peculiar to the
desert, that is the mingled product of a variety of resinous
plants. The weather is uniformly pleasant, and the elements
are rarely violently disturbed.</p>

<p>"In the older settled sections of our country, whenever
there is any sudden or extreme change of either heat or cold,
wet or dry, it is always followed by an increase of sickness
and death. The aged and invalid, who are sensitive and
weak, suffer most, as they feel every change in the weather.
There is, perhaps, no place on earth that can boast of a perfect
climate, but the country that can show the fewest and
mildest extremes approaches nearest to the ideal. The Southwest
is exceptionally favored in its climatic conditions."</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>There is a legend that the poetic, musical name, Arizona,
was derived from "Ari," a maiden queen who once ruled
the destinies of the Primas, and "Zon," a valley, from the
romantic configuration of the state, the two combining
into the melodious "Arizona." The tradition is sufficiently
romantic to be in keeping with the country it designates,
and nothing tends more to simplify the too complex
processes of life, not to say history, than to apply the rule
of believing those things that appeal to one's sense of the
"eternal fitness" and rejecting those which do not. The
apostles of the simple life might well include this contribution
toward simplicity as an axiom of their faith. At
all events, as no other origin of Arizona's pretty name is
on record, one may indulge himself in accepting this one
with a clear conscience.</p>

<p>The authentic Spanish history of Arizona dates to the
exploration of Mendoza in 1540. For nearly three hundred
years&mdash;until the treaty of Guadaloupe-Hidalgo in 1866,
when all the region north of the Gila and Mesilla valleys
was incorporated into the area of the United States&mdash;the
Spanish explorers and the Indian natives were in perpetual
conflict, and it was as late as 1863 that Arizona received
its name and individual domain as separate from New
Mexico, with which it had been incorporated. At the
time of the Guadaloupe-Hidalgo treaty Arizona did not
contain a single white settlement in the north and west.
Near Tucson and Tuba were a few hundred whites, but all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the other portions were the domain of the Apaches and
the Moquis. In 1856 the Hon. James Gadsden, then
United States Minister to Mexico, negotiated for the purchase
of this territory at a price of ten million dollars, and
the Mexican colors in Tucson were replaced by the Stars
and Stripes. On December 1, 1854, a memorial was presented
to the legislature of New Mexico for a separate territorial
organization and name of the new acquirement.</p>

<p>Although the Spanish civilization has long since receded
into the dim historic past, its spirit is impressed in the
very air; its zeal and fervor still, in some mysterious way,
permeate the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Until 1863 Arizona remained a portion of New Mexico,
the separate territorial government of each being inaugurated
at Fort Whipple, near Prescott,&mdash;a thriving town
of some six thousand people, named for the historian
whose works are the unquestionable authority on matters
of the Aztec and Spanish civilizations. Prescott is one of
the young Western cities that has a great future. Its
altitude insures it a delightful climate, the railroad facilities
are good, and it is in a region of almost fabulous
mineral wealth. The "United Verde" mine, one of the
possessions of Senator Clark of Montana, is some thirty-five
miles from Prescott and yields vast revenues. Within
thirty miles of the town there are very large beds of onyx,
one of which covers over one hundred acres. This onyx
is found in all colors,&mdash;the translucent old gold, green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
red, black, and white, with much in richly varied combinations
of color. Prescott has an altitude of a mile above
the sea and is a summer resort of itself for Ph&oelig;nix and
other Southern Arizona towns. It is a distance of some
three hundred miles from Ash Fork to Winhelman, and
Prescott and Ph&oelig;nix are one hundred miles apart, Prescott
being only a hundred miles from Ash Fork and Ph&oelig;nix
about the same distance from Winhelman. Near Prescott
there is a curious spot which is not less worthy of
world-wide fame than is the "Garden of the Gods" at
Colorado Springs; although the "Point of Rocks," as
this grotesque system of formation near Prescott is called,
is little known to travellers. It is of that same unique
sandstone formation that is found in the "Garden of the
Gods." Ruskin declared that he could not visit America
on the ground that it contained no castles; but had his
vision included Colorado and Arizona, with their wonderful
sandstone formations, he would have found castles galore
so far as scenic effect goes. It is not alone the "Garden
of the Gods" and the "Point of Rocks" that are marvellous
spectacles, but all over the states, here and there, on
foothill and mountain and mesa, these strange, fantastic,
colossal rock formations arise, that have all the landscape
effect of the castles and towers in Italy.</p>

<p>All the country around Prescott is alluring. On the
branch road from Ash Fork of the main transcontinental
line to Winhelman some three hundred miles south, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
is an assortment of scenery which might be described as
warranted to please every taste. There are lofty mountains
pine-clad and green with verdure; others are seen
barren and bleak, whose sides and foothills are only decorated
with the débris of mines. There are vast desert
solitudes where only the misshapen cacti grow, looming
up like giant skeletons in the air; and again there are
glades carpeted with a profusion of flowers in brilliant
hues. There are river-beds (arroyos) without any water
and there are streams that go wandering about, in aimless
fashion, devoid of regulation river-beds. Some of the arroyos,
indeed, have streams running in strong currents, but
they hide these streams under the river-bed, as something
too valuable perhaps for common view. The clairvoyance
of the scientific vision, however, detects this fraud on the
part of the arroyo at once, so that of late years it is of little
use for any well-regulated river to hide its current under
its bed. It may just as well relinquish the attempt and
let the stream run in an honest Eastern fashion, like the
Connecticut River, for instance, which is staid and steady,
like its state, and never undertakes to play pranks with
its current. Since the scientist has fixed his glittering eye
on Colorado and Arizona, all the gnomes and nixies have
the time of their life to elude this vigilance, and they
seldom succeed. The scientist relentlessly harnesses them
to his use; and though a river may think to conceal its
course by taking refuge under its bed instead of running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
honestly along above it, the effort is hopeless in an age
when the scientist is abroad. It is said that there are no
secrets in heaven, and apparently nature is very like
paradise in this respect at least, for it is quite useless for
her to pretend to keep her operations to herself. The
specialist, the expert, surprises every secret she may
treasure.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p240.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">LOOKING THROUGH A PART OF THE RIVER GORGE, FOOT OF
BAD TRAIL, GRAND CAÑON</p>

<p>Of all the rivers in Arizona no one has more entirely
defied all the accepted traditions of staying in its place
and keeping within its own limits than has the Colorado,
which, not content with the extraordinary part it plays
at the bottom of that Titanic chasm, the Grand Cañon,
is now creating an inland sea, named the Salton Sea, in
Southern California. Prof. N. H. Newell, the government
expert hydrographer of the United States Geological
Survey, has given close attention to the Colorado of late,
and of it he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... The Colorado cuts in its course the deepest cañons
on the face of the earth. From the solid rocks where it has
made them, through hundreds of miles, it has taken material
down to the Gulf of California, and by slight but regular annual
overflows gradually built banks on each side out into that
gulf. These, in time, cut off the head of the gulf, leaving
dry a depression in Southern California, considerably below
sea level, known as 'the Salton Sink.' For miles of its
journey the Southern Pacific runs below sea level. Ten
thousand people, approximately, in what is known as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Imperial Valley, live below the sea level. A privately owned
irrigation enterprise, on the Mexican side of the line, cut a
gash into this bank of the Colorado which nature had been
forming. The high waters came and man lost control of his
artificial channel, with the result that the river thought best
to pour its waters back into the depression which had once
been a part of the Gulf of California. To get the river to
resume its own course is no small task, and with it the
Southern Pacific railroad evidently purposes to grapple
heroically.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"The river is now pouring down a steep declivity into this
basin, which is two hundred feet or more below the sea level.
If this were allowed to continue, it would make a great salt lake
in Southern California. This water has already risen to the
point where it has submerged big salt works and fifteen miles
of the Southern Pacific's overland track, forcing that company
to build around the rising sea, and, unless its engineers
succeed in routing the Colorado for its old destination, it will
be necessary to rebuild a much longer piece of that road.
Some people have argued that such a sea would affect favorably
the climate of Southern California, but they forget that
the great Gulf of California, jutting into the most barren
regions of the United States and Mexico, seemingly has had
no good effect on the climate of either. The Salton Sea
would add only two per cent of water surface to that part of
the country, and so hardly would do what the Gulf of California
has not accomplished. Unless the break is restored,
the river will pour into this basin, forming a very shallow lake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
which would be almost a frying-pan under that semi-tropical
sun. This would continue to rise until evaporation balanced
the river flow, and then would fluctuate with the seasons of
the year, shrinking in area during the months of the heaviest
evaporation and slightest inflow.</p>

<p>"The gash in the river bank was cut by a Mexican corporation
on that side of the international line, but the water is
delivered to a number of American corporations, so that
to-day several are concerned in the affair. It is understood
that the Southern Pacific, when the river reaches its lowest
stage, will put in a great force of men in an endeavor to get
the river back to its former course. One great difficulty
comes in the sugar-like material which has been eroded, in
which it is extremely hard to insert any permanent structure.
A pile one hundred feet deep will be driven into it, and almost
as soon the water, working in under it, will lift it out."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Salton Sea, at this writing, covers an area of over
four hundred square miles, and is constantly increasing.
The Southern Pacific Railway that traversed its border has
been driven twice from its line and forced to lay new
roadbeds and tracks. It is also creating great confusion
as to irrigation facilities, both in the United States and
in Mexico, within the region where it lies; and as a
scientific event it is one of the first magnitude,&mdash;an act
in the drama of nature made visible to all.</p>

<p>The Salton Sink has long been known to the explorers
and visitors of this region. It was a vast basin of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
one hundred and forty miles in length and sixty-five or
seventy in width; the evident bed of a former sea, which
had become a desolate and barren waste. Sometimes a
mirage&mdash;a not unfrequent phenomenon in Arizona and
Southern California,&mdash;would transform this long deserted
basin into a phantom sea, wonderful in aspect.
To what extent this transformation will continue defies
prophecy.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;nix, the capital of Arizona, is in Maricopa County,&mdash;a
county as large as the entire state of Massachusetts.
The journey of two hundred miles between Ash Fork and
Ph&oelig;nix is one of the most uncanny and unearthly sort of
trips, with mountains resembling a witches' dance,&mdash;full
of grotesque wonder and romantic charm,&mdash;but the experience
is almost like visiting another planet and coming
under totally different conditions of life. Ph&oelig;nix is both
the capital and the metropolis of Arizona, and no city
west of the Mississippi is more popular among tourists or
is able to inspire a stronger sentiment of attachment among
its residents. To some twelve or thirteen thousand inhabitants
are added, every winter, from four to five thousand
tourists. The city lies in the centre of the Salt River
Valley,&mdash;that marvel of the Southwest. The most important
and valuable agricultural region in Colorado lies
in Maricopa County, of which Ph&oelig;nix is the pet and
pride. In this locality the visitor to Arizona returns to
the normal day and daylight world again. The forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
trees are not stone quarries, nor have meteors, wandering
through space, buried themselves in its soil. There is no
need of colossal magnetic appliances to seek to discover
and extricate some submerged star. Nor has the earth
opened and disclosed an Inferno, "bathed in celestial fires,"
as that of the Grand Cañon far away to the northwest.
The streams "stay put" within their legitimate borders,
and are apparently as firm in "standing pat" as is the
Republican party over a (new) tariff revision. Maricopa
County pursues a way of peaceful prosperity, with no lapse
into the vaudeville of petrified forests and buried stars.
Her stars make their appointed rounds in the skies, and
shine nightly upon the just and the unjust. In the
northern part of Maricopa there are mineral districts
of rich ores, gold and copper as well as silver, lead,
and others, but chiefly the county holds her way as an
agricultural region, indulging in no freaks. Canals radiate
in every direction from the Salt and the Verde rivers.
The Salt River Valley is so level that a theory prevails
that in some prehistoric ages it was smoothed by the
Toltec civilization, which even preceded that of the Aztec.
Fields of alfalfa, miles in extent, smile in the sunshine,
while cattle graze knee-deep in luxurious clover. Orange
groves alternate with the apple and apricot orchards.
The date-palm, the fig, and the olive trees abound. Beautiful
homes stand in spacious grounds shaded by the dark
foliage of the umbrella tree, through which gleams the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
scarlet of the oleander and the brilliant gold of the
pomegranate.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;nix offers to the resident or the visitor a good proportion
of the best that life can give: in good society, that
which is intelligent, moral, cultured, and sympathetic; in
an admirable school system; in churches of many denominations,&mdash;Catholic,
Episcopal, Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian,
Christian Science, and others,&mdash;all having their
fine houses of worship and earnest congregations. There
is an excellent and a constantly growing public library, and
there are four daily and several weekly newspapers, business
blocks that would do no discredit to any large Eastern
city, a circuit telephone system completely equipped, gas
and water works, free city and rural mail delivery, good
hotels, a theatre, and an opera house. There are banks
and a Board of Trade. There are clubs both of men and
women. The State Normal School of Arizona is nine
miles distant&mdash;in Tempe.</p>

<p>There are three railroads that centre in Ph&oelig;nix which
transport the traveller with the usual accepted ease and
luxury of modern railroading; and a new road to form a
link in a second Santa Fé transcontinental line will then
place Ph&oelig;nix on a trunk road over which the Santa Fé
traffic will largely pass.</p>

<p>The winters in Ph&oelig;nix are most attractive. From
October till May there is a climate all balm and sunshine
without the enervating quality felt in the tropics. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
region all around has good roads, and driving and riding
are most enjoyable.</p>

<p>Seventy-five miles east from Ph&oelig;nix, in the Tonto
Basin, the government is building a vast water storage
dam which it is expected will liberally irrigate two hundred
thousand acres of land which, under reclamation, will
produce in rich abundance both agricultural and horticultural
products. The climate and conditions combine
those of the temperate and the semi-tropical zones and
favor products grown in both. The Tonto dam will be,
with the possible exception of the Assouan dam in Egypt,
the greatest storage enterprise in the world. It will be
constructed of hard sandstone imbedded in cement, making
it as permanent as the mountains. It will be two hundred
and eighty-five feet above foundations and only two hundred
feet wide at the bottom. Above will be a lake about
twenty-five miles long, with storage capacity for one and
a half millions acre-feet, which means enough water to
cover that number of acres a foot deep. Even to the best
of cement, Nature has provided on the ground every necessity
for construction. Along the hillsides above is being
dug a power canal, to discharge above the dam, there to
generate not less than five thousand horsepower,&mdash;more
than enough for the demands of construction. When the
dam is finished this power will be transmitted electrically
to the vicinity of Ph&oelig;nix, here to be used for pumping.
The government engineers have made plans for eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
developing eighteen thousand horsepower, by harnessing
the falls of the river and the canals.</p>

<p>The Salt River Valley has more than fifty thousand
acres devoted to alfalfa, which sometimes yields six crops
in a year. Wheat, barley, and corn are also grown, and
the orange groves produce the finest fruit known in the
Eastern markets, antedating by a month the California
oranges. Grapes, apricots, and dates abound; and if
Maricopa County does not literally as well as figuratively
find that her land is flowing in milk and honey, it is
certainly not for lack of the most favorable conditions.</p>

<p>The Arizona strawberries, too, are a feature of importance
in the fruit market, as for both size and flavor they
absolutely exceed almost any other in the United States.</p>

<p>All this sunny prosperity of conditions and loveliness
of climate reacts on life. There is a poise, a serene confidence,
and a charm of good-will and joyous companionship
felt in Ph&oelig;nix that give to this delightful young city
an individuality of its own.</p>

<p>The great dam now being built in the Tonto Basin has
made it necessary to destroy the town of Roosevelt,&mdash;a
village of two thousand inhabitants, with its churches,
schools, water-works, electric lights, and other appliances
of modern civilization. "Roosevelt must perish," writes
a press correspondent, "that a desert may be made to bloom.
Already the marvellous engineering work is well under
way. The walls of the narrow cañon through which Salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
River rushes on edge are being locked by a massive monolith
of solid masonry, the highest arch dam in the world."</p>

<p>The writer continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This wonderful structure of sandstone and cement will
be two hundred and eighty feet in height from foundation to
parapet. Placed by the side of an eighteen-story skyscraper,
this dam would rise ten feet above it, while its length on top
would be more than two city blocks. A turbulent stream,
with its enormous floods, will beat itself into stillness against
the masonry monster, its foam and spume lost in a deep lake
twenty-five miles long and two miles wide.</p>

<p>"By day and by night the dull roar of dynamite breaks
the desert stillness, and the cañon walls go crashing down
to furnish material for this structure. On the hill far above,
the rock crushers never stop grinding the limestone, and
great kilns, white hot, are burning daily hundreds of barrels
of cement.</p>

<p>"When night comes, myriads of electric lights burst forth,
weirdly illuminating a busy army of toilers working gnome-like
in a shadowy cañon. A star-gemmed heaven looks down
upon a wondrous scene, unreal, awesome, and inspiring.</p>

<p>"This great work of the government possesses unusual
attractions for the engineer and the layman. It is located in
a valley which has been the abode of three races, one of
which lived here when Cæsar sat upon his throne. In an age
forgotten the cliff-dwellers built their eyrie-like homes along
the cañons of this stream, and in the narrow valleys the lines
of their irrigation canals may yet be traced. Centuries later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the Apaches came, and for many years their tepees dotted
the basin. Then came the white man, who sought to reconquer
the desert, which had resumed its sway after the cliff-dwellers
vanished.</p>

<p>"The battle with unfriendly nature proved too much for
the pioneer, and Uncle Sam took a hand in the fight. No
problems could daunt his engineers. They laughed at floods
and mocked at desolation. A dam site was discovered sixty-two
miles from a railroad, and they proceeded to connect it
with civilization by a marvellous road which winds its way for
forty miles through deep cañons, along the face of frowning
precipices, over foaming cataracts, and across broad areas of
treeless desert. It opens up to the transcontinental traveller
a new region of compelling interest and of splendid scenery.
Better than that, it provides an easy thoroughfare for the
transportation of heavy machinery of all kinds and the supplies
for the new community which sprang into life almost at
a word.</p>

<p>"... Every stone that is laid in the narrow arch, which
is to retain the foaming river now rushing through the
cañon, brings nearer and nearer the day when Roosevelt
shall vanish beneath an inland sea. When the great dam is
completed, in 1908, and its massive gates of steel, weighing
eight hundred thousand pounds, are shut down, a rising flood
will cover the site of the city with two hundred feet of
water.</p>

<p>"The ingenuity of man has been taxed in this work. Its
isolated position, the difficult physical conditions, the tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
and unexpected floods, have tried the mettle of the
engineers. The enormous amount of cement required was
in itself a problem which forced Uncle Sam to turn manufacturer
in order to solve it. Nature, having kindly furnished
an ideal site for a dam, was thoughtful enough to provide
materials near at hand for making cement. A cement mill
was quickly erected at a cost of one hundred thousand dollars.
The downward rush of the river was utilized for electric
power to operate the mill, and many thousand barrels of first-class
cement have already been used in the works.</p>

<p>"But while the city of Roosevelt, with the homes of its
two thousand inhabitants, is doomed, a fair valley is to be
redeemed in which the agricultural possibilities are not
exceeded anywhere in the world. Under almost tropical
skies, with a soil of wonderful fertility, the farmer in Salt
River Valley will cultivate his orange groves, his fig trees,
his vines, while his broad meadows will yield him heavy
harvests of alfalfa six and seven times a year.</p>

<p>"The great lake which will be created by the Roosevelt
dam is to be tapped by canals hundreds of miles long and
extending all over the broad valley around Ph&oelig;nix. Vast
areas now absolutely worthless will be transformed quickly
into blossoming orchards and purpling vineyards, and hundreds
of happy homes will dot a plain where now the giant
saguaro rears its spiny head and the Gila monster roams
at will."</p></blockquote>

<p>Life in the Far West is a continual series of the
occurrence of such events as these. Its problems are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
largely solved by the civil engineer and the irrigation
expert, who transform vast deserts to regions of blossoming
beauty, change the course of a river, send railroad
trains climbing the mountain peaks or penetrating beneath
the range, and who are, in short, the modern
magicians who work their will with the forces of nature.
The National Reclamation Act is fairly recreating the
entire Southwest.</p>

<p>The Gila River, which is the largest tributary of the
Colorado, flows through the regions south of Florence,
Arizona, and affords water to many fertile and beautiful
valleys; and Florence, with the towns of Yuma, Tucson,
Glendale, Bisbee, Winslow, and others, is fully abreast
in modern life. Large department stores, public libraries,
schools and churches, women's clubs, daily newspapers,
good railroad facilities, free postal delivery,&mdash;all these
make up the environment of a splendid and progressive
citizenship. As the Governor of Arizona, Hon. Joseph H.
Kirley, has recently said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nowhere can a man who respects his neighbor's rights,
with reasonably strict attention to his own business, go about
with more freedom and with greater confidence of personal
safety than in Arizona. Locked and barricaded doors are in
most parts of Arizona a novelty. The professional thief is
almost unknown in the territory."</p></blockquote>

<p>The East&mdash;at least the portion of it that has not
personally visited the magic land of Arizona&mdash;can form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
little idea of its marvellous resources and its potent
achievements.</p>

<p>The statehood problem looms up on the social and
political horizon, and there is a strong feeling that to
force Arizona and New Mexico into union would do violence
to the judgment and the feeling of the citizens of Arizona.
For several years past the incipient possibility of
statehood on these terms has aroused widespread opposition.</p>

<p>The local press voices almost daily the editorial convictions
that such a union would be most disastrous to
the interests of Arizona&mdash;a country which is simply a
wonderland of treasure and rich and varied resources.
Arizona is settled chiefly by people from the great South
and from New England, the Middle West being hardly
represented; its citizens are of the best quality of our
national life, and to unite them with those of New Mexico&mdash;a
large proportion of whom can hardly speak or understand
the English language even, to say nothing of their
divergence in race, requirements, and habits from the
population of Arizona&mdash;would be imposing upon them
a century's delay in realizing the grand ideals of education,
moral progress, and economic development now prevailing
in Arizona.</p>

<p>Ph&oelig;nix has to-day a better public-school system than
Boston, and other surprising degrees of progress might
be related of many of the towns.</p>

<p>Hon. N. O. Murphy, twice a Governor of Arizona,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
has recently made an eloquent plea against forcing these
two territories into union as a state. Ex-Governor Murphy
was appointed by President Harrison (in 1889) Secretary
of Arizona. Under President Cleveland he was elected
the Delegate to Congress representing the territorial interests;
and on the expiration of this term he was
appointed by President McKinley the Governor of the
territory. His experience has given him the most intimate
knowledge and wide grasp of territorial conditions,
and in a letter of three columns over his own signature to
the "Washington Post," appearing under date of February
25, 1906, ex-Governor Murphy does not hesitate to say
that were the Bill for united statehood then pending
before Congress passed, it would be one of the greatest
legislative outrages ever perpetrated in this country. "I
refer particularly to the proposed merger of the territories
of Arizona and New Mexico into a single state
against the protests of the people of those territories," he
added.</p>

<p>The ex-Governor points out these statistical facts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The area of New England, comprising six states, with
twelve senators, is 66,465 square miles; the area of the
territory of Arizona is nearly twice as great, being 113,916
square miles.</p>

<p>"The area of the territories of New Mexico and Arizona,
now proposed to be merged, is 235,600 square miles, or
greater than Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Rhode Island, Connecticut, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, and New Jersey, represented in the Upper
House now by twenty-two senators."</p></blockquote>

<p>The fact that the population of New Mexico is largely
Mexican, and that of Arizona is mostly American, suggests
a potent reason for the strong feeling in Arizona
against this proposition. Their racial instincts and their
business interests alike conflict. If they are joined as a
single state, there will be continual jealousy and friction,
and legislation to promote the interests of one-half the
state will necessarily be at the expense of the other.</p>

<p>To the traveller sensitive to the spell of a strange,
unearthly beauty, Arizona prefigures itself as the country
God remembered rather than as "the country God forgot."
It is at once the oldest and the newest of the states. Its
authentic and historic past antedates the coming of the
Mayflower to the rocky and desolate December shores of
Massachusetts, while its future flashes before one like an
electric panorama outspeeding wireless telegraphy. It is
the Land of Magic and Mystery. The light is a perpetual
radiance, as if proceeding from some alchemy of distilled
sunshine. While Colorado is the Land of Perpetual
Dawn, of an heroic and poetic achievement, Arizona is
the region of brooding mystery, of strange surprise.</p>

<p>There are the music and pictures of Arizona in her
fertile valleys, her wide rolling mesas; and the very
melody of the wind harps meet and mingle with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
organ strains of sweeping orchestral effects of the winds
in the cañons and in wild, desolate gorges where impenetrable
twilight renders them a veritable No Man's Land.
Mr. Aldrich's "Two Shapes" might have met in that uncanny
region of the Petrified Forest. The very dance of
the Brocken may nightly be seen in the midnight fissures
and steep precipices of the Grand Cañon.</p>

<p>It is, however, essentially the land of mirage and mystery,
this wonderful Arizona! As one journeys about
he half fancies that he hears on the air those magic lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"O birds of ether without wings!</div>
<div class="verse">O heavenly ships without a sail!"</div>
</div></div>

<p>Every incredible thing is possible in this miracle country,
where purple mountain peaks quiver in the shimmering
golden light, where ruins of remote ages stand side
by side with the primitive mechanism of pioneer living,
where snow-capped mountain peaks are watched from
valleys that have the temperature and the productions
of the tropics. Arizona contains unknown and undreamed-of
resources of gold, copper, and silver. The state has
the richest possibilities in mineral wealth; there are thousands
of square miles of range lands; there is wealth of
forests, although it is a part of the miracle character of
this state of color and dream life that its forests are
almost as much concealed from casual view as are its
minerals hidden in the depths of the earth, for they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
secluded in deep cañons or they are high out of sight on
the mountain summits. In fruits and flowers Arizona has
the luxurious growth and lavish abundance of the tropics,
producing grapes, figs, oranges, lemons, pomegranates,
pineapples, and peaches,&mdash;almost everything, indeed,
unless it be the apples of Hesperides.</p>

<p>Although Arizona has not the electric exhilaration and
infinite energy of Colorado, it has a delicious quality,
as if the very air were a caress. Though warm in the
south, the heat has none of the enervating effect of the
heat where humidity combines with it. The heat here is so
dry, the air so pure, that there is little extreme discomfort
even when the mercury soars to legendary altitudes. In
winter all Southern Arizona is a paradise of loveliness.
At this season the towns of Florence, Ph&oelig;nix, Tucson,
Yuma, and other points invite one to the balmy air, the
luminous brilliant skies, and the nights, which are a glory
of starry illumination. Northern Arizona has a perfection
of summer climate, and the Grand Cañon is destined
in the near future to become one of the great summer
resorts of the world. With the splendid facilities for
comfort offered by the arrangements, the traveller finds
all his accustomed conveniences, and the cañon has literally
all seasons for its own. There is one glory of July
and another glory of January; there is a transcendent
loveliness of June, and an equally indescribable charm of
October. No month is without its special reasons for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
visiting at that time this most marvellous scenic wonder
of the entire earth.</p>

<p>In remote ages Arizona was evidently an inland sea.</p>

<p>Montezuma Well, on the Verde River, some fifty miles
from Prescott, is one of the strange spectacles of Arizona.
The well is on an elevated mesa of solid limestone. It has
a circular opening some six hundred feet in diameter, as
perfect as if carved by a skilled workman. From the
surface opening down to the water is a distance of some
seventy feet, and the water itself is over one hundred feet
deep. It is perfectly clear and pure. Near the well are
several cave dwellings, and fragments of pottery abound
in the vicinity. There are beds of lava, also revealing that
the well is the crater of an extinct volcano.</p>

<p>There can be no question but that Arizona is one of
the most marvellous regions of the world. Its interest to
the tourist is not exceeded by that of the Yellowstone,
whose mountains and geysers and strange color effects
enchant poet and painter. For the cañon system of the
Arizona mountain ranges, the stupendous majesty of
scenic grandeur which reaches its supreme aspect in the
Grand Cañon of the Colorado, the wonders of extinct
volcanic action, the colossal channels cut by the action
of water, the unearthly splendor of the coloring in sky
and atmospheric effects, all combine to make this state
the very embodiment and visible expression of magic and
mystery.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>In the broken mountain ranges the detached peaks
extend, with narrow, fertile valleys lying between; while
deep cañons and wild gorges, with rushing mountain torrents,
still further diversify the grandeur of the panorama.
Five great rivers add another impressive feature,&mdash;the
Colorado, the San Juan, the Salinas, the Verde, and the
San Francisco,&mdash;this system of rivers completing the most
extraordinary combination of mountain, valley, mesa, and
cañon to be found in the entire world. Numberless extinct
volcanoes and vast lava beds add their fantastic imagery;
and the metamorphic rock strata, recording the most
violent volcanic upheavals, tell the prehistoric story of
the fiery molten flood which swept over all this region
when the earth was new.</p>

<p>As has perhaps been suggested in the preceding
pages, life in Arizona is by no means without its features
of entertainment. These include various aspects, not to
mention one that is by no means to be enjoyed in any
of the great Eastern centres,&mdash;that of the exclusive
annual festivity of the "Snake Dance." Chicago and
Paris, New York and London, may find social entertainment
in balls and opera, dancing and dining, but in Arizona
one goes to this entertainment on the Painted Desert;
and if in some happy summer of life one's horoscope has
deflected his course into Arizona and Colorado, one comes
to regard those fascinating localities with the devotion of
a native of their sunny climes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>After all, it is not length of time in any experience of
life that is significant, but intensity of feeling, and one
finds himself really living more intensely in a few weeks
in the Far West, in all its wonder world, than in years or
decades of his accustomed rounds in Eastern cities.</p>

<p>This entertainment of the Snake Dance is furnished by
the Moki Indians at their camp some seventy miles over
the desert from Flagstaff. There is no means of conveyance
save by wagons. The journey is over sagebrush and
sand, enlivened by stones and cacti. The horses can
make only slow progress. But the air is simply delightful
and full of exhilaration, and the particular desert over
which those who fare forth for this æsthetic spectacle
must pass is the "Painted Desert," whose walls of rocks
and mountains, brilliant in a dream of color, recede as they
are approached, and thus the entire two days consumed in
the journey are a perpetual delight to the eye. The wayfarers
camp out overnight, and during the five days' journey&mdash;two
days to go, two to return, and one to stay&mdash;their
wants are, perforce, reduced to the most primitive.
As the festivity lasts only twenty-eight minutes, it is certainly
spending a good deal of time and energy in order
to behold so brief a spectacle. But one is told it is
worth all the fatigue and the time. It is a religious rite
of the Moki Indians, and is a prayer for rain. The description
of it is a literal one, for the dancers hold from one
to three snakes&mdash;and rattlesnakes at that&mdash;in the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
as they perform their strange gyrations. The dancers
are the "braves," while the squaws chant a crooning
accompaniment.</p>

<p>One student of this Indian rite has said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With the first glow in the east the priests hasten to the
shrine of the Sun God with their offerings, the luminary
himself being greeted with a prayer or with songs as he
slowly emerges from behind the mesa in the Far East. Later
the priests repair to their homes, and return to the kiva,
bearing the ceremonial paraphernalia with which, early in
the afternoon, they robe themselves in gorgeous array preparatory
to the dance, which is given usually before the
sun sets behind the San Francisco Peaks.</p>

<p>"As the priests emerge from the kiva, where they wait in
line until all have appeared, there is the hush of expectancy
throughout the village; the inhabitants now line the terraces,
house-tops and every available spot around the dance plaza,
all being attired in their gayest and brightest costumes. In
single file and with measured tread comes the line of priests.
Entering the plaza, they wheel about and begin a slow, short
dance, the time of the step being accompanied by the shaking
of rattles and by the singing of sacred songs. The dance is
over all too soon, when the spectators return to their camps
and the priests to the kiva, where great quantities of food
have been brought for them. Finally, in a great feast, they
break the fast, which, on the part of the chief priests, has
been maintained for many days."</p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>It is quite by way of being love's labor lost to visit
Arizona during that period of time devoted to the Moqui
Festival. Apparently the entire population betake themselves
to this entertainment, journeying over the desert
in their wagons, carrying with them their beds, their food,
and every necessity, for except what they take with them
they must do without. But as all the world, alas, cannot
or does not dwell in Arizona,&mdash;a region in which any one
sunset alone is worth the journey there,&mdash;and is thus
deprived of the unique privilege of assisting at the Snake
Dance, the next best thing, as a substitute, is to read the
new work of George Wharton James (the author of "In
and Around the Grand Canyon") called "Indians of the
Painted Desert Region." It is the very gateway to a wide
and deeply interesting knowledge of Indian life in Arizona
and its relation to advancing civilization. It is the presentation
of a series of wonderful landscapes in a vivid
manner of word-picturing.</p>

<p>"Wild, weird, and mystic pictures are formed in the
mind by the very name&mdash;Painted Desert," writes Mr.
James. "The sound suggests a fabled rather than a real
land. Surely it must be akin to Atlantis or the island
of Circe or the place where the Cyclops lived. Is it not
a land of enchantment and dreams, not a place for living
men and women, Indians though they be?"</p>

<p>It seems that the Spaniards gave the name "El Pintado
Deserto"&mdash;the Painted Desert.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>"Stand with me," writes Mr. James, "on the summit
of one of the towering mountains that guard the region,
and you will see such a landscape of color as exists nowhere
else in the world. It suggests the thought of God's
original palette, where he experimented in color ere he
decided how to paint the sunset, tint the sun-kissed hills
at dawn, give red to the rose, green to the leaves, yellow
to the sunflowers.... Look! here is a vast field of alkali,&mdash;fine,
dazzling white. Yonder is a mural face half
a thousand feet high and two hundred or more miles long.
It is over a hundred miles away, but it reveals the rich
glowing red of its walls, and between it and us are vast
patches of pinks, grays, greens, carmines, blue, yellow,
crimson, and brown, blending in every conceivable shade
in a strange and grotesque yet fascinating manner. It
is a rainbow petrified. It is a sunset painted on desert
sands."</p>

<p>And here art and archæology may revel. "History&mdash;exciting,
thrilling, tragic&mdash;has been made in the Painted
Desert region; was being made centuries before Lief Ericson
landed on the shores of Vinland or John and Sebastian
Cabot sailed from Bristol.... In the Painted Desert
region we find peoples strange, peculiar, and interesting,
whose mythology is more fascinating than that of ancient
Greece, and for aught we know to the contrary, may be
equally ancient; whose ceremonies of to-day are more
elaborate than those of a devout Catholic, more complex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
than those of a Hindoo Pantheist, more weird than those
of a howling dervish of Turkistan.... One of the countries
comprised in the Painted Desert region is the theme
of an epoch ... reciting deeds as brave and heroic as
those of the Greeks at Marathon or Thermopylæ; a poem
recently discovered after having been buried in the tomb
of oblivion for over two hundred years. Here are peoples
to whom a written letter is witchcraft and sorcery, and
yet who can read the heavens, interpret the writings of the
clouds, deserts, and cañons with unerring certainty....
A land it is of witchcraft and sorcery, of horror and dread
of ghosts and goblins, of daily propitiations of fates and
powers, and princes of darkness and air, at the very thought
of whom withering injuries are sure to come."</p>

<p>One is tempted to run on and on in quotation from
this fascinating book, which depicts the strange life and
the marvellous scenery in the country "where atmospheric
colorings are so perfect and so divinely artistic that
desolate deserts are made dreams of glory."</p>

<p>Harriet Monroe, the Chicago poet, playwright, and
most charming of essayists, who by no means limits her
séances with the Muses to those particular hours in which
she dons her singing robes, has given this prose-poem
picture of a scene on the "Painted Desert":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The rocks lay in belts as red as flame, yellow as gold,
purple as violets, and they seemed to shine of their own
light; the City of Rocks, flaming red, and high as mountains;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
one thousand foot walls sheer to the desert, all carved in
needles, spires, towers, castles&mdash;the most tremendous thing
on earth&mdash;there it lay!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the sudden climatic changes of the desert Professor
James says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have been almost frozen in its piercing snowstorms;
choked with sand in its whirling sandstorms; wet through
ere I could dismount from my horse in its fierce rainstorms;
terrified and temporarily blinded by the brilliancy of its
lightning storms, and almost sunstruck by the scorching
power of the sun in its desolate confines.... With my
horses I have camped, again and again, waterless, on its arid
and inhospitable rocks and sands, and prayed for morning,
only to resume our exhausting journey in the fiercely beating
rays of the burning sun; longing for some pool of water, no
matter how dirty, how stagnant, that our parched tongues
and throats might feel the delight of swallowing something
fluid. And last year (1902), in a journey to the home of
the Hopi, my friends and I saw a part of this desert covered
with the waters of a fierce rainstorm as if it were an
ocean, and the 'dry-wash' of the Oraibi the scene of a flood
that for hours equalled the rapids of the Colorado River.
Desert though it is in the main,&mdash;barren, wild, and desolate,&mdash;here
and there within its boundaries are fertile valleys,
wooded slopes, and garden spots as rich as any on earth; and
the people who make their dwelling-place in this inhospitable
land present characteristics as strongly contrasted as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
of nature. Here are peoples of uncertain and mysterious
origin whose history is preserved only in fantastic legends
and traditional songs; whose government is as pure and perfect
as that of the patriarchs, and possibly as ancient, and yet
more republican than the most modern of existing governments;
peoples whose women build and own the houses,
and whose men weave the garments of the women, knit the
stockings of their own wear, and are as expert with needle
and thread as their ancestors were with bow and arrow,
obsidian-tipped spear, or stone battle-axe.... Here are
peoples of stupendous religious beliefs. Peoples who can
truthfully be designated as the most religious of the world,
yet peoples as agnostic and sceptic, if not as learned as
Hume, Voltaire, Spencer, and Ingersoll. Peoples to whom
a written letter is witchcraft and sorcery, and yet who can
read the heavens, interpret the writings of the woods, deserts,
and cañons with a certainty never failing.... Here are
intelligent farmers who for centuries have scientifically irrigated
their lands and yet who cut off the ears of their burros
to keep them from stealing corn.... Peoples who pray by
machinery as the Burmese use their prayer wheels, and who
'plant' supplications as a gardener plants trees and shrubs....
Peoples who are pantheists, sun worshippers, and snake
dancers, yet who have churches and convents built with
incredible labor and as extensive as any modern cathedral.
Peoples whose conservatism in manners and religion surpasses
that of the veriest English Tories; who for hundreds
of years have steadily and successfully resisted all efforts to
'convert' and change them, and who to-day are as firm in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
their faiths as ever.... Peoples to whom fraternal organizations
and secret societies, for men and women alike, are as
ancient as the mountains they inhabit, whose lodgerooms are
more wonderful, and whose signs and passwords more complex,
than those of any organization of civilized lands and modern
times."</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most weird and fascinating experiences in
Arizona is a visit to "Assamanuda," the "Country of the
Departed Spirits." This is the poetic name the Iroquois
Indians give to the Painted Desert. This vast plain
stretches away with gigantic horizontal columns, the remains
of vast layers of sedimentary rock, from which the
rains of prehistoric ages have washed away the connecting
earth, and the columns are streaked and mottled with
scarlet, due, it is said, to the oxidization of particles of
feldspar in the granite of which these rocks are composed.
Here may be witnessed in its perfection the Fata Morgana.
In the air appear palaces, hanging gardens, and
temples; fountains and wonderful parks adorned with
sculpture; towers and turreted castles; beautiful villas
with terraced lawns and cascades of water thrown high
in the air; rose gardens and hills, where the deer and the
antelope are seen; all these and other visions of loveliness
are pictured on the air in a perfection of light and shading.
It is not difficult to fancy that one is really gazing into
the ethereal world, beyond the pearly gates, and gazing
indeed into "the country of departed spirits."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>All Northern and Northeastern Arizona are comprised
in the region,&mdash;Nature's picture gallery. Dr. Newberry,
the geologist, who explored all the regions east of the
upper Colorado as far as the junction of the Green and
the Grand rivers, thus pictures one view of the plateau:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Directly south the view was bounded by the high and distant
mesas of the Navajo country, succeeded in the southwest
by the still more lofty battlements of the great white mesa
formerly seen from the Moqui pueblos. On these high tablelands
the outlines were not only distinctly visible, but grand
and impressive at the distance of a hundred miles. Nearly
west a great gap opened in the high tablelands through
which the San Juan flows to its junction with the Colorado.
The distance between the mesa walls is perhaps ten miles,
and scattered over it are castle-like buttes and slender towers,
none of which can be less than a thousand feet in height,
their sides absolutely perpendicular and their forms wonderful
imitations of architectural art. Illuminated by the setting
sun the outlines of these singular objects come out sharp
and distinct with such exact similitude to art that we could
hardly resist conviction that we beheld the walls and towers
of some ancient Cyclopean city, hitherto undiscovered."</p></blockquote>

<p class="caption">SUWARA (GIANT CACTUS), SALT RIVER VALLEY, ARIZONA</p>

<p>Every journey in Arizona seems to lead on into an
enchanted world. The gray valley road, the curious mesa
formations that stretch into infinite distances; the mystic
apparition in the Estrella range of the Montezuma faces;
the ruins of Casa Grande, which tell their tale of a massive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
city that once existed here; the ruins on the Rio Verde;
the mounds and shafts discovered belonging to some prehistoric
civilization; the ancient watch tower; the painted
rocks, with their extensive hieroglyphics,&mdash;all speak to the
archæologist in a language that fascinates the imagination.
Its three greatest features&mdash;the Grand Cañon,
regarding which there is neither speech nor language;
the Petrified Forest, and that Submerged Star known
as "Meteorite Mountain"&mdash;would alone make it the
world mecca of scientists; to say nothing of the strange
ruins of prehistoric peoples, of an unearthly beauty of
atmospheric coloring, and of the contemporary scientific
interest of the great Lowell Observatory at Flagstaff,
or the splendid progress and development of the people.
It might well have been of this marvellous country that
Emerson wrote:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A June</span> day in the Petrified Forests of Arizona is an
experience that can never fade from memory. Every excursion
into this strange, uncanny realm of Arizona, which
is an empire in its area; every journey one takes, every
trail he follows, leads into strange and fascinating locality;
and Adamana, the gateway to the Petrified Forests, has its
own spellbinding power for the tourist. Adamana consists
of a water tank, the station, and two bungalows, in
one of which very comfortable entertainment is offered,
and in the other of which dwells a character whom all
travellers meet,&mdash;Adam Hanna, a distant relative of the
late Mark Hanna, the original settler of this region.
For a long time the place was known as Adam Hanna's,
and when with advancing civilization this designation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
became too colloquial for an up-to-date twentieth-century
world, the elision of two or three letters gave the present
attractive name,&mdash;Adamana.</p>

<p>To leave the comfortable ease of a Pullman sleeper at
the witching hour of five in the morning to stop over at
Adamana and visit the Petrified Forest requires a degree
of fortitude beyond that usually calculated. Left to one's
self, one would emulate the example of the man who journeyed
to the north pole to see a sunrise that occurred only
three days in the year. On the first two mornings he refused
to rise on the plea of the further extension of his
opportunities; on the third, when his servant reminded
him that it was the "last call," he turned over and philosophically
remarked that he would come again next year.
But the dusky porter allows the tourist no such margin
for reflection, and one finds himself standing in some wonderful
place spellbound by the witchery of the desert, and
the long train vanishing in the distance, almost before he
knows whether he has exchanged the land of dreams for
the land of day and daylight realities,&mdash;for this weird and
mystic panorama of the infinite desert, with the bluest of
turquoise skies already lighted by the blazing splendor of
the June sunrise, and the grotesque, uncanny buttes scattered
at intervals all over that vast plain. The intense
silence was unbroken save by the voice and footstep of the
man representing the little bungalow termed the Forest
Hotel. Contrary to one's preconceived ideas of an Arizona<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
desert, the morning was cold, and the blazing fire and hot
coffee were most grateful. But where was the "Petrified
Forest"? one marvelled. Away on the horizon gleamed
an evanescent, palpitating region of shimmering color.
Yet this was not the "quarry of jewels," but the "Bad
Lands," which have at least one redeeming virtue, whatever
their vices,&mdash;that of producing the most aërial and
fairy-like color effects imaginable.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how swiftly one relinquishes preconceived
ideas of living and learns to get on without electric
bells, long-distance telephones, and elaborate conveniences
in general, even to the "prepared air," strained through
thin layers of cloth, as the latest superfine condition
added to a great New York hotel, and adapts one's self
to a mode of life in which a simple but very clean room,
primitive food, wonderful air, good, kind people, and a
petrified forest to amuse him, take the place of the
complex and elaborate life of the great Eastern cities.
At Adamana one finds himself seventy-five miles from
Gallup, New Mexico, the nearest town of any importance,
from which all household supplies must be ordered.
When the coffee gives out, for instance, seventy-five miles
from a lemon; and when a Sunday and a holiday have
almost followed each other, thus delaying all orders, one
has then the most delightful and spacious opportunities
for experimenting on the simple life. The desert offers
other things; and while these do not include the menu of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Sherry's, for instance, they do include certain allurements
for which the country might be searched in vain, as they
only exist on the Colorado desert. The quality of the air,
the color of the sky, the marvel of color vistas,&mdash;all make
up a new world in which one finds himself fairly questioning
regarding his own identity. Nor has he any apparent
test by which to determine&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"If I am I, as I do hope I be."</p>

<p>Perhaps, indeed, he does not so tenaciously cling to
that which he remembers of himself yesterday, and is
rather interested, on the whole, in accepting some possibly
new transformation of his being. The locality
seems to him sufficiently well indicated as being, according
to his first impression, simply somewhere in the magic
and witchery of space. This address might not be accepted
by the government postal service, but even that
heretofore indispensable matter in some way fades into
comparative insignificance. What does one who has an
Arizona sky, and a bewildering shimmer of color afar on
the horizon that might be</p>

<p class="center">"A painted ship upon a painted ocean"</p>

<p>or almost anything else,&mdash;what does he want of the
sublunary detail of eight postal deliveries a day, beginning
at half-past seven in the morning, with his first
dawn of returning consciousness, and ending with midnight,
when he is, very likely, summoned out of his sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
by the rap of a bellboy delivering more mail,&mdash;more,&mdash;as
if he had not been under an avalanche of it all
day and had sought refuge in dreamland for the very
purpose of escaping the vigilance of his national postal
service. But one may as well accept the fact as one from
which there is no appeal, that in the heart of civilization
he cannot escape its burdens and its penalties. He can
only evade them by going to&mdash;Adamana, for instance;
Adamana, the metropolis of the railroad water-tank, the
station, and two bungalows. Even these are too many.
One bungalow is enough. He cannot repose in two at
the same time; and as for neighbors and news,&mdash;has
he not the stars and the sunsets? What does Emily
Dickinson say?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"The only news I know</div>
<div class="verse">Is bulletins all day</div>
<div class="verse">From Immortality."</div>
</div></div>

<p>There are no birds to</p>

<p class="center">"... carol undeceiving things,"</p>

<p>as in Colorado; but there is, instead, intense silence,&mdash;a
silence so absolutely intense as to be, by a paradox, fairly
vocal; and if one does but catch the music of the spheres
for which he finds himself listening, it must be that his
powers of hearing are defective. One recalls the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"Who loves the music of the spheres</div>
<div class="verse">And lives on earth, must close his ears</div>
<div class="verse">To many voices that he hears."</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>The "many voices" are stilled; one has left them at
least seventy-five miles away,&mdash;in Gallup, for instance!
Gallup, that for the time prefigures itself to him as his
New York, his Paris, his London. It is the source of
all his possible supplies; and that it does not assume
an overwhelming importance is simply because he does
not want any supplies of the particular nature that
Gallup&mdash;or Paris&mdash;can furnish. He has achieved something
more than the power to satisfy all his (former)
multitudinous wants; he has eliminated them.</p>

<p>To be sure, the Chinese have a proverb that it is not
worth while to cut off one's feet to save buying shoes.
Yet, if instead of depriving himself of feet he has
achieved wings, why, manifestly, there is no need of
shoes. There are, when one comes to think of it, a
vast number of things in our late civilization for which
there is no special need.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">'Tis only God may be had for the asking."</div>
</div></div>

<p>In fact, when one comes to reflect upon the aspects of
his former life (as he sees them in mental panorama from
Adamana), he can only arrive at the conclusion that life
is unnecessarily choked and submerged under an ever-increasing
burden of <i>things</i>. Emerson, of course, whose
insight saw the universe as a crystal sphere which revealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
to his vision its entire working mechanism,&mdash;Emerson long
since announced that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"Things are in the saddle</div>
<div class="verse">And ride mankind."</div>
</div></div>

<p>Why should one be ridden by things? Why should
he enslave himself,&mdash;mortgage his entire powers of achievement,
such as they are, to pay his bills to the butcher,
the baker, and the candlestick maker? Is not the life
more than meat, and the spirit than fine raiment? So
he may dream for the moment, gazing meditatively at the
water-tank, the station, and the two bungalows that comprise
Adamana. Good for that day only, at least, is its
contrast to the bewildering din of <i>entrepôts</i>, of ports, of
custom-houses, of the general din and warfare of the
world he has left behind.</p>

<p class="caption">SAN FRANCISCO PEAK, NEAR FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA</p>

<p>Holbrook, the other station for the Petrified Forests,
is twenty miles away. Flagstaff, a very thriving and interesting
Arizona town, famous as the site of the Observatory
of Prof. Percival Lowell of Boston, is one hundred
and fifty miles to the west; and one hour of railroad
journey beyond Flagstaff is Williams, the town from
which runs the branch railroad to the Grand Cañon over
the rolling mesas crowned with the beautiful peaks of the
San Francisco mountains, a distance of sixty-three miles,
the journey occupying three hours. The nearest town
to Adamana station, in which a daily paper is published,
is Albuquerque, in New Mexico, which is nine hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
and thirty-five miles to the east, almost as far as from
New York to Chicago. The metropolis to which this
region looks as its nearest large city is Los Angeles,
twenty-six hours distant. So here one is out of the
world, so to speak,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"The world forgetting, by the world forgot,"&mdash;</p>

<p>with the vast rolling mesas, with sandstone cliffs offering
an uncanny landscape before the eye, with the eternal
blue of Arizona skies bending above, with a silence so
deep brooding over the desert that one might well feel
himself on the moon rather than on earth,&mdash;a silence only
broken by the semi-daily rush of the long overland trains
and occasional freight lines that pass.</p>



<p>John Muir, the famous California naturalist, explorer,
and author of valuable books on the Western parks, passed
the winter of 1905-06 at Adamana with his two daughters,
the Misses Wanda and Helen Muir, and it is he who has
discovered the new Petrified Forest which he calls the
"Blue Forest"&mdash;all the specimens having a deep blue
tone, while the other three are simply quarries of red
moss, agate, amethyst, topaz, pale rose crystals gleaming
against a smoky green ground. The landscape effect of
the "Bad Lands" from the little bungalow known as
the Forest Hotel is of fairy-like enchantment. A shimmer
of rose and gray and gold and emerald, it gleams on the
horizon. Lighted by a blazing sunset, it might well be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
the gates of a New Jerusalem. Anything more exquisite,
and more ineffably ethereal in coloring, one might journey
far to seek.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"Moreover, something is, or seems,</div>
<div class="verse">That touches us like mystic gleams,</div>
<div class="verse">Like glimpses of forgotten dreams."</div>
</div></div>

<p>These lines may, perchance, come echoing around one
in the air as he loiters at night on the low, long piazza,
while the myriad meteors of Arizona skies blaze their way
through the transparent air and a sky full of stars contends
with the moon for brilliancy; the unearthly, delicate,
ethereal coloring of the "Bad Lands" gleaming
resplendent on the distant horizon.</p>

<p>If the wanderer has fallen upon particularly fortunate
days in his horoscope and found Miss Wanda Muir&mdash;her
quaint name coming from her mother, the daughter of a
Polish nobleman&mdash;to drive him out to this marvellous
"forest" of stone, he will have a pleasure enhanced by
interesting conversation. A graduate of Berkeley College
in California, and the constant companion of her father in
his wanderings, Miss Muir is indeed an ideal guide, and
under her hand one June morning the two horses sped
along over the rough, stony ground at a pace to set every
fibre tingling. One of the features of the Arizona desert
is the arroyo, a dry stream, a ready-made river, so to speak,
minus the water. Some of these even have a stream of
flowing water, only it is under the bed of the river rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
than on top of it, for Arizona is the land of magic and
wonder and of a general reversal of accepted conditions.</p>

<p>"Sometimes in driving out here," said Miss Muir, "a
cloudburst comes up while we are in the Petrified Forests,
and on returning the horses have to swim this dry stream.
Once the water was so high it came into the wagon. Not
infrequently, when we go out to the forest, some one comes
dashing after us on horseback to warn us to get back as
quickly as possible, or the torrents of water from a sudden
cloudburst will cut us off altogether, perhaps for a day and
a night." The pleasing uncertainty of life in Arizona may
be realized from this danger of being suddenly drowned
in the arid sands of a desert, and being confronted with a
sudden Lodore that descends from the heavens on a midsummer
noon. But, as one is constantly saying to himself,
Arizona is the land of surprises. No known laws of
meteorology, or of any other form of science, hold good
here. The mountain peak transforms itself into the bottom
of a sea, and the sea suddenly upheaves itself in air
and figures as a mountain. Arizona is nature's kaleidoscope;
it is the land of transformation.</p>

<p>Of the three petrified forests, each separated by a mile
or two, the first is reached by a drive of some six miles,
while the third is more than twice as far. The second is
the largest and most elaborate, and in the aggregate
they cover an area of over two thousand acres. The
ground is the high rolling mesas, and over it are scattered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
"thick as leaves in Vallombrosa," the jewel-like fragments
of mighty trees in deposits that are the wonder of the
scientist. From the huge fallen tree trunks, many of these
being over two hundred feet in length and of similar proportions
in diameter, to the mere chips and twigs, the
forests are transmuted into agate and onyx and chalcedony.
Numbers of these specimens contain perfect crystals.
They are vivid and striking in color,&mdash;in rich Byzantine
red, deep greens and purples and yellow, white and translucent,
or dark in all color blendings. Great blocks of
agate cover many parts of the forest. Hundreds of entire
trees are seen. When cut transversely these logs show the
bark, the inner fibre, and veining as perfectly as would a
living tree. And over all these fallen monarchs of a prehistoric
forest bends the wonderful turquoise sky of Arizona,
and the air is all the liquid gold of the intense sunshine.</p>

<p>At Tiffany's in New York may be seen huge slabs and
sections of this petrified wood under high polish. A fine
exhibit of it was made at the Paris exposition in 1900,
and a specimen of it was presented to Rodin, the great
sculptor, who was incredulous of the possibility that this
block, apparently of onyx, could have been wood. Through
all the forests are these strange rock formations called
buttes, rising in the most weird shapes from the sand and
stones and sagebrush of the vast desert. What a treasure-ground
of antiquity! This region, which seems a plain,
is yet higher than the top of Mount Washington, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
altitude insures almost perpetual coolness. Scientists seem
to agree in the theory that the petrified forests are a debatable
phenomenon whose origin eludes any final conclusion.
It is possible that some mighty sea suddenly arose&mdash;perhaps
as the present Salton Sea in Southern California&mdash;and
engulfed them. The land is partly the "bad lands"
and partly a sandy plain covered with petrifactions. The
third forest contains hundreds of unbroken tree trunks, of
which some are over two hundred feet in length. Many
of these are partly imbedded in the earth.</p>

<p>All around this high plateau rise on the horizon surrounding
cliffs to the height of one hundred and fifty and
more feet, serrated into ravines and gorges, variegated with
the sandstone formations in all their shimmer of colors, and
indicating that this basin was once the bottom of a sea.</p>

<p>It is the paradise of the ethnologist as well as of the
geologist. Besides cliff ruins and hieroglyphics, almost
anywhere, by chance, one may find traces of submerged
walls, and following these, a man with an ordinary spade
may dig up prehistoric pottery, skeletons, beads, rings,
and occasionally necklaces. The pottery, both in design
and in scheme of decoration, shows a high degree of
civilization. Who were these prehistoric peoples who had
built their pueblos and created their implements and
pottery and were already old when Plymouth Rock was
new? Much of the symbolic creation here still awaits
its interpreter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>From these millions of tons of glistening, shining
blocks and segments and tree trunks the tourist is not
allowed to carry away specimens <i>carte blanche</i>, as formerly.
The Petrified Forests are now a government reservation,
although not yet one of the government parks.
Small specimens, within a reasonable amount, are permitted
the tourist as souvenirs.</p>

<p>The Petrified Forests are quarries rather than forests;
the great fallen logs, branches, and chips, lying prostrate
on the ground, are seen glowing and gleaming like jewels.
So far as the eye can reach there is not a human habitation.
Over the infinite stretch of sand and rocks bends
the bluest of skies, and here and there are prehistoric Indian
mines, and one ledge of cliffs on which are strange
and as yet undeciphered hieroglyphics. The graves of
the prehistoric inhabitants of this region are numerous,
each containing rare and choice specimens of pottery
which are dug out intact. This region seems to have
been once thickly populated. The remains of pueblos
are numerous. Skeletons are constantly being found.</p>

<p>Although the visitor is not allowed to carry away with
him a trainload or so of specimens, he may still be permitted
a beautiful cross-section of an entire tree trunk,
showing all the veins of the wood and the bark, a specimen
thin enough to be portable, and worthy a place in
any cabinet of curiosities, besides many chips showing all
the range of beautiful colors which abound in Chalcedony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Park. In this park lies a vast fallen tree trunk that
forms a natural bridge over a chasm,&mdash;a bridge that
seems to be of solid agate. These forests are among the
great scenic wonders of the world, and if they were in the
heart of the Himalayas or some other especially inaccessible
spot, all good Americans would hasten to visit them.
But our own wonderful and incomparable scenic grandeur
is neglected. These "Petrified Forests" are the marvel
of the geologist. What has happened, in all the phenomena
of nature, to produce this incredible spectacle?
Many scientific men believe that these forests did not
grow on the spot where they now would lie prostrate,
but were swept down by floods when this region was a
vast inland sea, and that they became imbedded in the
sand; that then the sea vanished and volcanic eruptions
poured over, and the wood was hardened to rock. Again,
a flood of water passed over and washed away the sand
and silt, and the erosion left these thousands of acres of
petrifactions exposed on the surface as now; and thus, after
millenniums have passed, we have these quarries of chalcedony
and agate, onyx, cornelian, topaz, and amethyst.</p>

<p>Every evening at Adamana disclosed a sky panorama of
kaleidoscopic wonder. Afar to the horizon the Bad Lands
shimmered in a faint dream of colors under the full moon.
The stars seemed to hang midway in the air, and frequent
meteors blazed through the vast, mysterious space.
Adamana is nine hours from Albuquerque, the metropolis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
of New Mexico, and five hours distant from Flagstaff,
to the west. All the thousands of acres of desert lands
about require only water to render them richly productive.
But water is unattainable. There are no mountain ranges
near enough to produce water storage, and unless the
twentieth-century scientists discover some way of creating
rain, these arid regions must remain as they are. Yet
even here American life and energy and progress are seen.
The scattered settlers unite in maintaining public schools
six months in the year, and with only from twelve to
twenty pupils the teacher is paid from seventy-five to
eighty dollars a month,&mdash;more than twice the salary paid
in the country schools in New England. In the little
bungalow here at Adamana, where Mr. Stevenson, the
government guardian of the Petrified Forests, makes
tourists strangely comfortable during their desert sojourn,
one finds a piano, a well-selected little library, and
young people whose command of the violin and piano offer
music that is by no means unacceptable. The children
get music lessons&mdash;no one knows how; they are eager
for any instruction in language, and acquire French and
Spanish in some measure, and in all ways the national
ambition is sustained. From Albuquerque comes a daily
paper, and only one day behind date the Los Angeles
papers arrive. One is not out of the world (alas!) even
on the Arizona desert.</p>

<p>It is a new world in itself,&mdash;the desert of Arizona. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
region on the earth is more diversified, more intensely interesting.
This desert comprises mountains and plains;
it contains that one supreme scenic wonder of the world,
the Grand Cañon; in it are Cañon Diablo and the Meteorite
Mountain. Within its area also is the "Tonto
Basin,"&mdash;an incalculable chaos of isolated and unrelated
cliffs, and crags of mountains peaks that have lost their
mountains, and general wreck and ruin. One might fancy
that at the end of creation, when the universe itself was
completed, all the chips and fragments and débris in general
were hurled into the Tonto Basin,&mdash;only that, of
course, the universe was never "made," but is always in
the making; only that the physical configuration of the
entire earth is always in process of transformation into
new aspects, and nowhere is this progress of the ages more
extraordinarily in evidence than in Arizona.</p>

<p>Leaving the Petrified Forest for the Grand Cañon, one
has a wonderful journey of six hours to Williams, and
thence three hours over the branch road to Bright Angel,
where the new and magnificent hotel, "El Tovar," captivates
the travellers, and from which a stage runs to Grand
View, thirteen miles away, where Vishnu Temple, the Coliseum,
Solomon's Temple, and other wonders of the marvellous
sandstone architecture, in the depths of the Grand
Cañon are viewed.</p>

<p>In waiting for the train on the branch road running
from Williams to the Grand Cañon over the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
San Franciscan mountains, the hour of waiting at Williams
is made a delight by a most unique and interesting curiosity
shop under the splendid Harvey management, where
all kinds of natural curiosities and Indian and Mexican
things are shown. The walls are hung with bright-hued
blankets and rugs, the ceiling is decorated and draped,
easy-chairs and sofas abound, and these tend to make the
journey a kind of royal progress.</p>

<p>In 1540 Pedro de Tovar, one of the officers who accompanied
Coronado through his great expedition, passed
through Arizona. Even then an extinct civilization was
already old. The ruins of the dwellings of those prehistoric
people abound near Flagstaff. In the recesses of
Walnut Cañon there are found cliff-dwellings in great
numbers. "Some of these are in ruins, and have but a
narrow shelf of the once broad floor of solid rock left
to evidence their extreme antiquity. Others are almost
wholly intact, having stubbornly resisted the weathering
of time." Nothing but fragments of pottery now remain of
the many quaint implements and trinkets that characterized
these dwellings at the time of their discovery.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Fixed like swallows' nests upon the face of a precipice,
approachable from above or below only by deliberate and
cautious climbing, these dwellings have the appearance of
fortified retreats rather than habitual abodes. That there
was a time in the remotest past when warlike peoples of
mysterious origin passed southward over this plateau is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
generally credited. And the existence of the cliff-dwellings
is ascribed to the exigencies of that dark period when the
inhabitants of the plateau, unable to cope with the superior
energy, intelligence, and numbers of the descending hordes,
devised these unassailable retreats. All their quaintness and
antiquity cannot conceal the deep pathos of their being, for
tragedy is written all over these poor hovels hung between
earth and sky. Their builders hold no smallest niche in
recorded history. Their aspirations, their struggles, and their
fate are all unwritten, save on these crumbling stones, which
are their sole monument and meagre epitaph. Here once
they dwelt. They left no other print on time."</p></blockquote>

<p>Flagstaff is a pleasant mountain town some seven thousand
feet above sea level, and is particularly fortunate in
being the site of the Lowell Observatory, founded by
Professor Percival Lowell of Boston, which brings eminent
astronomers and scientists to the place. In the Lowell
Observatory some of the best work in modern science is
being accomplished, and Professor Lowell and his staff
have for some years been devoting themselves to the
special study of Mars. Flagstaff was selected for the site
of the observatory on account of the singularly clear and
still air of Arizona. It is an atmosphere almost without
vibration. Never were distances more curiously deceiving
to the eye than in Arizona. A point that is apparently
only a few yards away may be, in reality, at a distance of
two miles. Professor Lowell and his staff have, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
exceptional facilities for their work, and Mr. Carl Otto
Lampland, the stellar photographer of the staff, has taken
impressions of Mars that seem to leave little doubt in the
minds of experts that canals on that planet reflect themselves
by the camera. This achievement is recognized by
astronomers everywhere as marking an epoch in the study
of Mars and as fairly closing the argument regarding the
possibility of canals on that body by bringing their construction
there as an unquestionable fact. It was Schiaparelli,
the Italian astronomer, who first observed what
he believed were canals on Mars. His report was received
with incredulity; but his theory has been so reinforced and
supported by actual results of observations since then that
it is now generally accepted. Early in the decade of 1880-90
Professor Lowell began a special study at Flagstaff with his
fine twenty-four-inch telescope, but it was in May, 1905,
that the first results of real significance were obtained. The
light about Mars is said to be faint, and the vibrations in
the air, though less in Arizona than is usual elsewhere, still
produced disturbing effects on the plate. It is said that
Mr. Lampland overcame this difficulty after a long series
of experiments, "by using a diaphragm on the telescope,
cutting down the aperture from twenty-four inches to
twelve inches, as a rule. Though this diaphragming of a
photographic lens is not new, this was the first time it was
applied to a glass as large as twenty-four inches in diameter
and for such faint objects. Hitherto astronomers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
been more concerned with availing themselves of the light-gathering
power of the large lenses. It was a distinct advance,
and is the one step to which the largest share of the
credit is due of successfully photographing the canals."</p>

<p>In the vestibule of the Institute of Technology in
Boston were shown in the spring of 1906 a number of
these photographs. To the uninitiated they merely presented
a black ground with white lines faintly defined.
Professor Lowell says that the special significance of the
photographs lies in the fact that they corroborate the
results shown by other photographers of Mars, and that
they also corroborate the methods. That the sensitive
plate of the camera will record a star never visible
through even the strongest glass, and thus prove its
existence, is a wonderful fact in stellar photography.</p>

<p>Cañon Diablo is one of the volcanic phenomena of Arizona,&mdash;a
narrow chasm some two hundred and fifty feet
deep, several miles long, and five or six hundred feet wide,
which the Santa Fé road crosses on a wonderful steel spider-web
bridge a few miles before reaching Flagstaff. It is one
of the curious things for which the tourist is watching.
For so intensely interesting is the entire journey westward
after leaving La Junta in Colorado, that the traveller
who realizes the wonderland through which he is passing
is very much on the alert for the landscape.</p>

<p>Between Adamana and Flagstaff is a strangely interesting
country. Here is Meteorite Mountain, where evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
a huge meteor fell into the earth with terrific force, upheaving
all the surrounding crust and thus producing a
mountain with an enormous cavity in its centre. For five
years men have been digging here to find the meteor.
They have excavated huge fragments of it. The vast
hollow crater where the meteorite is supposed to have
fallen into the ground is a mile wide. In some fragments
of the meteor which were submitted to Sir William
Crookes for examination that great scientist found
diamonds in small but unmistakable quantities.</p>

<p>The Meteorite Mountain is situated not more than ten
miles south of Cañon Diablo, from which station the
traveller may drive to this phenomenal cavity. Within
recent months shafts are being projected into the earth
to discover, if possible, whether the meteoric theory is
the true one. More and more, with every year, is science
undertaking to "pluck out the heart of the mystery"
in this problematic Arizona. Prof. G. K. Gilbert, of the
United States Geological Survey, has made a special study
of this phenomenon, and it is he who experimented with
a magnetic test, assuming that if an enormous meteorite
had hurled itself into the earth until it was buried past
excavation, the great mass of metallic iron would still respond
to the test, and furnish unmistakable proof of its
presence if subjected to magnetic attraction. A scientific
writer who has recently made a study of Meteorite Mountain
thus reports the conditions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The mountain is about two hundred feet high, and there
are a few stunted pines about its forbidding looking slopes.
Going to the top of this mountain, over huge masses of
strange-looking rock, one will find a great depression, generally
called the crater, though there are no evidences of its
volcanic formation. This crater is a huge bowl one mile
across and six hundred feet deep. The winds of the desert
have blown much sand into the crater, evidently covering the
bottom of the depression to a depth of many feet. There is
a level space of about forty acres in the bottom of the crater.</p>

<p>"When the gigantic meteor fell hissing into the earth, if
it ever did so, the concussion must have been terrific. And
in this connection it is interesting to note that the Indians
near by have a legend about a huge star falling out of the
heavens and dazzling the tribe with its brightness. Then
there was a great shock and sudden darkness, and ever since
then the Indians have regarded Meteorite Mountain with
awe. Some idea of the action of the meteorite can be
obtained by throwing a stone into the mud. When the
meteorite buried itself far into the earth the sides were
heaved up, leaving a rim-like circle about the depression.
As the meteorite sank into the earth it must have crushed
layers of red sandstone and limestone. It is believed that
the white sand found in the crater and on the sides of the
mountain is from the sandstone pulverized by the meteor in
its descent. This sand was blown skyward and afterward
settled down on the mountain, covering it thickly. No sand
like it is to be found near the mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>"Men searching the ground surrounding the mountain for
a distance of several miles find small meteorites. Several of
these weigh as much as one thousand pounds, and others
weigh only a fraction of an ounce. The largest pieces were
found furthest from the mountain. These meteorites have
been proved to be practically non-magnetic. This may explain
why the immense body of iron in the buried meteor has
not shown any magnetic properties. Needles taken to the
mountain have not shown the presence of any great magnetic
attraction, and this fact puzzled scientists until it was found
that the fragments found near the mountain did not possess
magnetism.</p>

<p>"Another interesting discovery is the presence of what is
called 'iron shale' near the mountain. These are fragments
of burned or 'dead' iron. They might have been broken
from the meteorite at the time of the terrific impact, or they
might have been snapped from the larger body owing to a
sudden cooling process. Inasmuch as the Cañon Diablo
country was at one time an immense inland sea, another
interesting theory has been brought forth,&mdash;that the meteor
fell into this sea, and that the great number of splinters of
iron in the neighborhood were caused by the sudden cooling
of the molten mass. It has been discovered that these small
meteorites contain diamonds."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the immediate vicinity of Meteorite Mountain several
tons of meteoric fragments have been found of which
Prof. George Wharton James has one, weighing about
a ton, on his lawn at his charming residence in Pasadena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
There are also found in this vicinity large amounts of shale
which scientists pronounce analogous to the meteorite, but
"dead"; yet this shale is highly magnetic and possesses
polarity,&mdash;one of the most mysterious and incomprehensible
properties of electricity.</p>

<p>Professor Gilbert did not meet success when he tried
the magnetic test, and in discussing this matter in an
address on "The Origin of Hypotheses," delivered before
the Geological Society in Washington last year, he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Still another contribution to the subject, while it does
not increase the number of hypotheses, is nevertheless important
in that it tends to diminish the weight of the magnetic
evidence and thus to reopen the question which Mr. Baker
and I supposed we had settled. Our fellow-member, Mr.
Edwin E. Howell, through whose hands much of the meteoric
iron had passed, points out that each of the iron masses,
great and small, is in itself a complete individual. They
have none of the characters that would be found if they had
been broken one from another, and yet, as they are all of
one type and all reached the earth within a small district, it
must be supposed that they were originally connected in
some way.</p>

<p>"Reasoning by analogy from the characters of other meteoric
bodies, he infers that the irons were all included in a
large mass of some different material, either crystalline rock,
such as constitutes the class of meteorites called 'stony,' or
else a compound of iron and sulphur, similar to certain nodules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
discovered inside the iron masses when sawn in two. Neither
of these materials is so enduring as iron, and the fact that
they are not now found on the plain does not prove their
original absence. Moreover, the plain is strewn in the vicinity
of the crater with bits of limonite, a mineral frequently
produced by the action of air and water on iron sulphides,
and this material is much more abundant than the iron. If
it be true that the iron masses were thus embedded, like
plums in an astral pudding, the hypothetic buried star might
have great size and yet only small power to attract the magnetic
needle. Mr. Howell also proposes a qualification of
the test by volumes, suggesting that some of the rocks beneath
the buried star might have been condensed by the
shock so as to occupy less space.</p>

<p>"These considerations are eminently pertinent to the
study of the crater and will find appropriate place in any
comprehensive discussion of its origin; but the fact which is
peculiarly worthy of note at the present time is their ability
to unsettle a conclusion that was beginning to feel itself
secure. This illustrates the tentative nature not only of
the hypotheses of science, but of what science calls its
results.</p>

<p>"The method of hypotheses, and that method is the
method of science, founds its explanations of nature wholly
on observed facts, and its results are ever subject to the
limitations imposed by imperfect observation. However
grand, however widely accepted, however useful its conclusions,
none is so sure that it cannot be called into question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
by a newly discovered fact. In the domain of the world's
knowledge there is no infallibility."</p></blockquote>

<p>Sir William Crookes has been deeply interested in the
phenomenon of Meteorite Mountain, which must take rank
with the Petrified Forests and even with the Grand Cañon
as one of the marvels of Arizona. The meteoric shower
which seems to have accompanied the falling of the
huge meteorite&mdash;if the theory of its existence is true&mdash;has
recorded its traces over a radius of more than five
miles from the crater-like cavity. The experiment of
Dr. Foote is thus described:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"An ardent mineralogist, the late Dr. Foote, in cutting
a section of this meteorite, found the tools were injured by
something vastly harder than metallic iron, and an emery
wheel used in grinding the iron had been ruined. He examined
the specimen chemically, and soon after announced to
the scientific world that the Cañon Diablo Meteorite contained
black and transparent diamonds. This startling discovery
was afterwards verified by Professors Friedel and
Moissan, who found that the Cañon Diablo Meteorite contained
the three varieties of carbon,&mdash;diamond (transparent
and black), graphite, and amorphous carbon. Since this revelation
the search for diamonds in meteorites has occupied the
attention of chemists all over the world.</p>

<p>"Here, then, we have absolute proof of the truth of the
meteoric theory. Under atmospheric influences the iron
would rapidly oxidize and rust away, coloring the adjacent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
soil with red oxide of iron. The meteoric diamonds would
be unaffected and left on the surface to be found by explorers
when oxidation had removed the last proof of their celestial
origin. That there are still lumps of iron left in Arizona is
merely due to the extreme dryness of the climate and the
comparatively short time that the iron has been on our planet.
We are here witnesses to the course of an event which may
have happened in geologic times anywhere on the earth's
surface."</p></blockquote>

<p>In this desert plateau of dull red sandstone worn by
the erosion and the storms of untold ages, does there
indeed lie a submerged star? And if there does, buried
so deep in the earth as to elude as yet all the research
of science, what force projected it, "shot madly from its
sphere," into the desert lands of Arizona? To visit these
extraordinary things&mdash;the Petrified Forests, the Meteorite
Mountain, the Grand Cañon&mdash;is to feel, in the words
of the poet,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Los Angeles</span>, "the City of the Angels," is invested with
the same poetic suggestion in its name as that which surrounds
Santa Fé,&mdash;"the City of the Holy Faith." A
terraced street is known as "Angel Flight." Any retrospective
contemplation of Los Angeles gives one the sensation
of having been whirled through the starry immensities
of space. During even a brief stay one afterward discovers
by the unerring logic of mathematics that within a few
days he has perhaps travelled some four hundred miles by
the electric trolley cars, besides his motor-car journeys
when shot through space from old San Gabriel to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Pacific Coast, or from Elysium Park to Hollywood, and
far and away on the opposite side of the city. Were one
caught up in an aëro-car, journeying far above the clouds
for ten days, it could hardly seem more unreal. One can
only think of Los Angeles as the City of Vast Spaces.
The town has laid out all the surrounding country, one
would fancy, in beautiful tracts (there are over four
thousand), each tract containing several acres,&mdash;laid
out under alluring names, with streets, sidewalks, and
lamp-posts.</p>

<p>The "boom" is something tremendous. Companies
and corporations run free electric cars to points forty
miles out of town, as Redondo Beach and other localities,
for people to inspect the lots offered,&mdash;lots at
prices from "four dollars down, and four dollars a
month," with the entire cost from ninety dollars up
to that of several hundred. If all the world is not
supplied with homes it is not the fault of enterprising
Los Angeles. The incomparable electric trolley system
renders the entire region within fifty miles around
eligible for city privileges. People think nothing of
going thirty, forty, even seventy-five miles by the
"express electrics." Over an area of a thousand miles
in length and perhaps one hundred and fifty in width
there is scattered a population less than that centred
within city limits in Chicago. The world is wide&mdash;in
Southern California. There is nothing of the dreamy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
languorous old Spanish atmosphere in Los Angeles. It is
the most electrically up-to-date city imaginable. The city
limits comprise over twenty-eight thousand acres. The
streets are paved and oiled; the lighting is wonderful,
most of it being done from tall towers rather than ordinary
lamp-posts. Not even New York has any street or avenue
so illuminated by night as is Broadway in Los Angeles,
where, as in the boulevards in Paris, one can easily read
by the street lights. Los Angeles has twenty-one great
parks and innumerable hills and valleys in the residence regions.
This diversity affords natural facilities for landscape
gardening which are utilized with fine effect. Spacious
boulevards, artificial lakes, and series of terraces everywhere
enchant the eye, seen amidst the bewildering luxuriance of
creamy magnolia blossoms and the graceful pepper tree.</p>

<p>The enterprise of Los Angeles is equalled by the refinement
and culture of the people, and the schools, churches,
libraries&mdash;the social life&mdash;all reveal the best spirit of
American institutions.</p>

<p>That this is one of the spellbinding cities goes without
saying. Everything is in gleam and glitter and
glow. The electric car and the telephone system are
here developed to a higher degree than perhaps in any
other Western city except Denver. The growth of Los
Angeles is something fairly incredible. A leading park
commissioner, Dr. Lamb, has described the beauty of the
four thousand tracts of land (each tract comprising many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
acres), all laid out, ready for buyers and builders. Of
the twenty-one parks, one comprises more than three
thousand acres, and another, Elysium Park, over eight
hundred acres of hills and valleys already decoratively
laid out with terraced drives and beautiful shrubs,
flowers, and artificial lakes. The trend of the city is
rapidly toward the ocean, some fifteen to twenty miles
away, and it can hardly be five years before from
Venice and Santa Monica, on the coast, to Pasadena,
ten miles to the east of Los Angeles, there will be one
solid city, one vast metropolis of the Southwest. The
public library is ably administered, and it is one of considerable
breadth of resources, with the advantage of
having for its librarian Mr. Charles F. Lummis, the
well-known writer on the Southwest. Madam Severance,
who in 1878 founded the Woman's Club, a large and
influential association of which for many years she was
the president, and Mrs. Rebecca Spring, the friend of
Margaret Fuller, are two Boston women who have
transferred their homes to Los Angeles and whose lives
emphasize Emerson's assertion that it is the fine souls
who serve us and not what we call fine society.</p>

<p>The rush and the brilliancy of life in all this Los
Angeles region transcend description. Broadway has
more than two miles of fine business blocks, the architecture
being restricted to some eight or nine stories.
The beautiful parks, with their artificial lakes, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
date-palm trees, their profusion of brilliant flowers,
attract the eye. There are residence sections of exceeding
beauty,&mdash;the lawns bordered by hedges of rosebushes
in full bloom and perhaps another rose hedge separating
the sidewalk from the street.</p>

<p>From the high plateaus of Northern Arizona to the
blossoming plains of California is a contrast indeed. In
Arizona these thousands of acres need only irrigation to
become richly productive. The climate is delightful, for
the elevation&mdash;over seven thousand feet&mdash;insures coolness
and exhilaration almost every day through the
summer. But at present there seems no conceivable way
to procure water with which to irrigate. In California
precisely the same land is irrigated and has also the advantage
of a rainy season, and the vegetation and fruits
abound luxuriously. Orange groves, with the golden
fruit shimmering on the trees; lemon groves, olive orchards,
and the avenues and groves of the eucalyptus tree make
fair the landscape. An important industry here is that
of lima beans. Tracts of fifteen hundred acres sown with
these are not unusual, and the crops are contracted for by
Russia and Germany almost as soon as sown. On one
of these it is said that the owner had made a princely
fortune within two years. The creation of the city in
imagination is in great favor. Vast tracts of country
from one to ten miles outside the city limits are
staked out, as before noted; avenues and streets defined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
and named, lamp-posts erected, an attractive name given
the locality, and lots are offered for sale from perhaps four
or five hundred dollars up, on the terms of "fifty dollars
down and ten dollars a month."</p>

<p>The trolley-car service in and around Los Angeles
is said to be the best in the world. To Venice and Santa
Monica, on the beach,&mdash;at a distance of some seventeen
miles,&mdash;there are electric "flyers" that make the trip
within thirty minutes. Venice is a French Étretat. The
little rows of streets at right angles with the coast line,
running down to the water, are named "Rose Avenue,"
"Ozone Avenue," "Sunset Street," and other alluring
names. This Venice is a veritable (refined and artistic)
"Midway," with its colonnades of shops offering every
conceivable phase of trinkets and <i>bijouterie</i>; its concert
halls, casino, gay little restaurants, and every conceivable
variety of amusement. It is the most unique little toy
town of a creation conceivable, and the electrical display
and decorations at night are fascinating in their scenic
effect.</p>

<p>Santa Monica, some two miles farther up the coast, is
still, stately, and poetic. Here the blue Pacific rolls in in
the most bewildering sea greens and deep blues, and over
it bends a sky rivalling that of Arizona in depth and
richness of color. The entire Pacific Coast is an idyl of
landscape loveliness.</p>

<p>But of life. What are the people of this lovely young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
city of two hundred thousand inhabitants doing and
thinking? It is not a question to be answered in a
paragraph. Life here is intense, interesting, full of color
and movement, and its many-faceted aspects invite consideration.
As one sits, for instance, on a Pasadena
piazza, with the golden glory of the sunset seen over the
Sierra Madre, and the rose hedges, the orange groves, the
great bushes of heliotrope that are almost like young trees
pouring out their mingled fragrance on the evening air,
one falls under its spell. As the twilight deepens into
darkness the great searchlight from Mount Lowe, directly
in the foreground, a picturesque panorama, may swing out
with its weird, sweeping, dazzling illumination over the
scene. When this searchlight is out, people at the far-away
beaches can see to read by it at distances of from
twenty-five to fifty miles. Quite near Mount Lowe&mdash;one
of the adjacent peaks&mdash;is Mount Wilson, on which the
new Carnegie Observatory is to be located. This will be
fitted with the largest telescope in the world and will have
the advantage of every latest scientific appliance.</p>

<p>Pasadena, like all the California towns and cities,
covers very large tracts of country. There is a thriving
business centre, not very far from which are the great
Raymond Hotel and other winter resorts for the throngs
of tourists who are almost as important to the revenues of
California as they are to Italy. There are both North
and South Pasadena,&mdash;each almost a separate city in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
itself,&mdash;and the most beautiful street is Orange Grove
Avenue, with large estates on either side and spacious
lawns. On Fair Oaks Avenue, in a pretty cottage, lives
Prof. George Wharton James, the famous explorer, scientist,
and notable writer on the Grand Cañon in Arizona,&mdash;and
the greatest interpreter, indeed, of the entire Southwest.
The books of Professor James, "In and Out of
the Old Missions of California," "The Indians of the
Painted Desert," and "Indian Basketry" (besides his book
on the "Grand Canyon," which is the accepted authority),
interpret the many phases of life in the Southwest in a
vivid and accurate manner, rendering them invaluable
to contemporary literature. Professor James makes his
original explorations, taking with him an assistant and
his own camera, and going through varied hardships,
almost greater than could be realized. In the vast
desert spaces, remote from any human habitation, he
has had to swim large, muddy, inland lakes, where
vermin were swarming; to go without food and water,
and to endure the intense fatigue of long tramps. In
perusing his books the reader little dreams at what
fearful cost of energy all this original material was
obtained. In his home Professor James has a most
interesting collection of the <i>objets d'art</i> of the Southwest.
One must travel over this part of the country in order
to appreciate them. They are as distinctive of New
Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California as the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
masters and other phases of Italian art are of Italy.
There are brilliant Navajo blankets and rugs&mdash;soft,
rich, and vivid in color, with curiously decorated designs;
the most interesting array of Indian pottery&mdash;the
many specimens from the old tombs being far finer
than any pottery done by the modern Indians; and at
the entrance to his lawn Professor James has a huge
meteorite from Meteorite Mountain in Arizona, which
weighs over a ton. He has a large section of a tree of
the Petrified Forest, and the finer specimens that show the
bark and the fibre, and also the crystallization. His
library is large and fine, and comprises many autograph
gift copies from other authors.</p>

<p>One feature of the life of Professor James is especially
helpful. In his spacious library upstairs, on every
Thursday evening, he gives an informal talk on his travels
and explorations to his friends and neighbors. His
personal experiences in studying the phenomenon of the
Salton Sea and the vagaries of the Colorado River, which
is a law unto itself, are most interesting.</p>

<p>The call of the wild is not more irresistible than the
call of the desert to Professor James. He has lived on
it and with it, and learned to read its hieroglyphics.
The desert spirits have companioned him. He has explored
vast spaces of the Grand Cañon; he has encamped,
day after day, even week after week, on the Painted Desert;
he has wandered in the grim strange Tonto Basin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
sailed (of late) the Salton Sea,&mdash;this sheet of four hundred
square miles of water, this impromptu lake where
but a little while before was a deserted hollow of a long
extinct volcanic sea. Nature leads man a pretty dance
out in this Land of Enchantment. No one would venture
to prophesy at night just what stage transformation
might take place before morning. This very uncertainty
of any particular tenure of mountain, sea, or desert perhaps
tends, unconsciously, to so react upon the population
that their more real life is thrown forward into the
future. For instance, Los Angeles lays no particular stress
upon her present population, but announces that by 1910
the figures will undoubtedly reach the half-million mark.
Nor, indeed, can the observer doubt this in any contemplation
of the present incredible rapidity of progress in
every direction. The city seems half made up of millionnaires,
and the latest municipal bank clearings amounted
to almost four hundred millions of dollars. Los Angeles
is really an exotic, for the latest census reveals the astonishing
fact that ninety per cent of its inhabitants are from
the East, leaving only ten per cent as native Californians.
Never was the advertising of a city carried out to the
degree of being fairly a fine art so wonderfully as in Los
Angeles. In the Chamber of Commerce there is a perpetual
exhibition of fruits and flowers in season, and of
the products and manufactures of the country.</p>

<p>Los Angeles, like most of the other more important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
Western cities, is deeply concerned with irrigation schemes.
This region of California supplements its rainfall with irrigation,
and between the two the whole country is in bloom
and blossom. Los Angeles is now arranging a gigantic
scheme to bring water from the Owen's River, two hundred
miles away, by means of tunnels through mountains and a
huge canal. This fall of water will not only entirely
supply the city with water power of immense force and
volume, but it is estimated that it will also irrigate a
hundred thousand acres. The scheme will employ five
thousand men for some four years, and it is estimated that
the cost will be twenty-five millions. No undertaking
daunts the Western city. If an enterprise is desirable, it
is to be achieved. That is the law and the prophets in
the Land of Enchantment.</p>

<p>Los Angeles, like Colorado Springs, is the paradise of
excursions. The trip up Mount Lowe to the observatory
offers a magnificent panorama of landscape, including Pasadena
Valley and Catalina and Santa Barbara islands. Old
San Gabriel Mission and the San Gabriel Valley are infinitely
interesting, and the famous bells of San Gabriel still
ring in their quaint, rude stone framework even though they
are jangled and out of tune with the lapse of years. The
Sierra Nevada Mountains rise from the San Gabriel Valley.</p>

<p>One of the excursions has a feature that is new to every
visitor,&mdash;that of glass-bottom power boats which give a
view of the marvels of the ocean. These boats run from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Avalon on the coast&mdash;an hour's express trolley ride from
Los Angeles&mdash;to the submarine gardens adjoining Catalina
Island, and they have a capacity to seat over a hundred
passengers around the glass. In sailing over these
submarine gardens the boats move very slowly, that the
passengers may enjoy the view of the strange seaweed, the
marine flowers, the varied aquatic vegetation. Catalina
Island is a favorite sea resort, lying in such convenient
proximity to the city.</p>

<p>Los Angeles seems to be the paradise of every one
who has a new idea&mdash;or ideal&mdash;for the betterment
of humanity. There is an atmosphere of idealism.
Among the recent institutions is the Pacific School of
Osteopathy, with a faculty of thirty physicians, men
and women, who base their therapeutics on the scientific
fact that the body is subject to chemical, electrical,
thermal, mental, and mechanical treatment. In the line
of ethics Rev. B. Fay Mills has established a comprehensive
movement of "Fellowship," including religious
services and social intercourse, with a large and enthusiastic
membership drawn by this eloquent orator and
preacher who for many years before in his pastorate in
Boston preached to large congregations who gave him
profound appreciation.</p>

<p>A most important centre that radiates sweetness and
light in infinite measure is that of Christ Church (Episcopal),
whose rector, Rev. Baker P. Lee, is not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
eminent as a preacher, but as a leader and inspirer of
a network of organizations connected with the church
for the betterment of human life. Christ Church parish
is a large one, numbering over two thousand in direct
connection with the church, with a list of communicants
of over twelve hundred. Within the past three years
the parish has built a magnificent new church and a
rectory, and the holy earnestness of the young and gifted
rector makes the work one of vital spirituality.</p>

<p>No city can offer more beautiful homes than those
of Los Angeles; more attractive parks, more enchanting
scenery, or more delightful excursions over a network of
electric lines which aggregate above five hundred miles
of single track and reach one hundred towns and villages
from Monrovia of the foothills to Redondo by the sea.
The world has but one Southern California, with its cool,
soft, gray sea-fogs in the early mornings, followed by
its cloudless days of blue sky over golden sunshine; where
the sea-breeze gladly brings its health-giving ozone in
exchange for the odors of orange blossoms and roses;
where the mountains stand glorying in the ruggedness
of their rocky cliffs until, touched by sunset's wand, they
glow with pink lights and purple shadows; and over all
comes a golden radiance that changes the forbidding
outlines of their jagged peaks into radiant beauty,&mdash;fitting
features of the vast panorama of nature to hold
their eternal place in the Land of Enchantment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> takes the wings of the morning and arrives at the
uttermost parts of the earth to find&mdash;the Grand Cañon,
the scenic marvel of the entire world.</p>

<p>Only to the poet's vision is the Grand Cañon revealed;
only to the poet's touch do its mighty harmonies respond.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
For this sublime spectacle is as vital as a drama enacted
on the stage, only its acts require the centuries and the
ages in which to represent themselves. Whatever one sees
of the Grand Cañon,&mdash;it matters not from what commanding
view of vision or vista, one sees only an infinitesimal
point. It is the Carnival of the Gods. "Prophets
and poets had wandered here," writes Harriet Monroe,
"before they were born to tell their mighty tales,&mdash;Isaiah
and Æschylus and Dante, the giants who dared the
utmost. Here at last the souls of great architects must
find their dreams fulfilled; must recognize the primal
inspiration which, after long ages, had achieved Assyrian
palaces, the temples and pyramids of Egypt, the fortresses
and towered cathedrals of mediæval Europe. For the
inscrutable Prince of builders had reared these imperishable
monuments, evenly terraced upward from the remote
abyss; had so cunningly planned them that mortal foot
could never climb and enter to disturb the everlasting
hush. Of all richest elements they were fashioned,&mdash;jasper
and chalcedony, topaz, beryl, and amethyst, fire-hearted
opal, and pearl; for they caught and held the
most delicate colors of a dream and flashed full recognition
to the sun. Never on earth could such glory be unveiled,&mdash;not
on level spaces of sea, not on the cold bare peaks
of mountains. This was not earth; for was not heaven
itself across there, rising above yonder alabaster marge in
opalescent ranks for the principalities and powers?...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
In a moment we stood at the end of the world, at the
brink of the kingdoms of peace and pain. The gorgeous
purples of sunset fell into darkness and rose into light over
mansions colossal beyond the needs of our puny unwinged
race. Terrific abysses yawned and darkened; magical
heights glowed with iridescent fire."</p>

<p>If one pauses for a moment with any sense of obligation
to himself to gain some <i>rationale</i> of this cañon; if for a
moment he turn from rhapsody and ecstasy and the dream
of poet and painter to grope after statistical estimates,
what does he find? One comparison is that,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If the Eiffel Tower, which with a height of almost a
thousand feet is the tallest structure in the world, were placed
at the bottom of the cañon in its deepest part, five more
towers just like the first would have to be piled on top of one
another to reach the rim of the plateau."</p></blockquote>

<p>And again:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Could the cañon be filled in for a building site, it would
furnish room enough for fifty New York cities. Indeed, it
would have an area of sixteen thousand square miles, equal
to the whole of Switzerland, or the states of Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode Island combined."</p></blockquote>

<p>Statistical comparisons are, at best, a necessary evil
which, once confronted, need not companion one further.
It is beauty, it is sublimity, not mathematical assurances,
that really lays hold on life. The inexplicable impressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
made by this spectacle are mirrored in the following
words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As I grew familiar with the vision I could not quite explain
its stupendous quality. From mountain tops one looks
across greater distances and sees range after range lifting
snowy peaks into the blue. The ocean reaches out into
boundless space, and the ebb and flow of its waters have the
beauty of rhythmic motion and exquisitely varied color.
And in the rush of mighty cataracts are power and splendor
and majestic peace. Yet for grandeur appalling and unearthly;
for ineffable, impossible beauty, the cañon transcends
all these. It is as though to the glory of nature
were added the glory of art; as though, to achieve her utmost,
the proud young world had commanded architecture
to build for her and color to grace the building. The irregular
masses of mountains, cast up out of the molten earth in
some primeval war of elements, bear no relation to these
prodigious symmetrical edifices mounted on abysmal terraces
and grouped into spacious harmonies which give form to
one's dreams of heaven. The sweetness of green does not
last forever, but these mightily varied purples are eternal.
All that grows and moves must perish, while these silent
immensities endure."</p></blockquote>

<p>The majestic panorama dominates every detail of daily
life. As when in Bayreuth for the Wagner music-dramas
alone, every other consideration is subordinated to these,
so in life in El Tovar, on Bright Angel Trail, one's hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
for sleep and for any daily occupations are held strictly
amenable to "effects" in the mysterious splendor of the
Titanic underworld. To see the cañon under the full
moon; to see it when all the pinnacles of rock are leaping
in rose-red flame under a sunrise; to see it in a dream of
twilight as the purple canopy falls,&mdash;all these hours,&mdash;all
hours are made for the magical transformations. With
every breath of change of the atmosphere this celestial
beauty changes. One is hardly conscious as to the special
ways and means by which he finds himself in an enchanted
world,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"From the shore of souls arrived?"</p>

<p>It is very possible. Nor does he know how&mdash;or when&mdash;he
shall depart. The past is effaced, and the future recedes
into some unformulated atmosphere. Life, a thousand
lifetimes, concentrate themselves in the present. A
supreme experience has always this peculiarity,&mdash;that it
bars out all the past and all the future. When one is on
the Mount of Transfiguration, he is not scrutinizing the
pathway by which he came nor that by which he may
descend.</p>

<p>Even if one has seen the Grand Cañon before, he is surprised
to find how absolutely newly created it is to him
when its haunting magic draws him back. No enshrined
memory can compare with the reality. In seeing the
Petrified Forest one checks it off as a thing accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
for life. It is definite. The great logs of agate and jasper
and chalcedony lie on the ground as they have lain for
perhaps thousands of ages. It is a wonder&mdash;the seventh
wonder of the world, if one pleases and&mdash;the paradise of
geologists, but it is unchanging. Not so the Grand
Cañon. The cañon is a perpetual transformation scene.
Its color effects rival those of an electric fountain
under the full play of the spectroscope. It is rose,
purple, amber, emerald, pearl gray, pale blue, scarlet&mdash;according
to atmospheric states. One leaves it in the
late afternoon with the rocky towers and pinnacles and
battlements all in glowing scarlet, seen through a transparent
air. He steps out upon the broad hotel
piazzas an hour later and, behold, the uncalculated spaces
of the cañon are filled with a half-transparent blue mist
which envelops all the curious sandstone formations that
gleam in pale rose and opal tints through this thin blue
mist, and assume wraith-like shapes. Major Powell well
said, that really to see the Grand Cañon, a year is necessary.
Yet just as truly may it be said that even for two days it
is worth crossing the continent to enjoy this most marvellous
of spectacles. Only the scientist and the specialist
dream of seeing it in anything like completeness. For
the tourist and traveller a range of twenty miles is quite
sufficient to disclose its representative beauty. A day's
drive by the stage to Grandview Point, Hance's Trail, and
Moran's Point is easily made between nine and five o'clock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
A drive of two or three miles in the opposite direction
will include Rowe's and O'Neil's points. One day will
allow the adventurous tourist to "go down the trail." Still,
after doing all these things, the best of all, it may be, is
to live into the atmosphere. To draw one's chair out on
the broad balcony of the new and beautiful hotel, El
Tovar, and sit and dream and gaze and wonder, and
wonder and gaze and dream, is, perhaps, the greatest joy
one can have in all the time passed here, especially if
the solitude can be the solitude <i>à deux</i>. No joy, no interest,
is of much consequence until or unless it is sympathetically
shared. As a <i>décor de scène</i> the Grand Cañon
is unrivalled. The magic and mystery of all the universe
broods over its Titanic spaces.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p316.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">GRAND CAÑON, FROM GRAND VIEW POINT</p>

<p>The air is the most bracing, exhilarating, and exquisite
imaginable. The great rolling mesas covered with pine
forests are more than seven thousand feet above the sea,
and their exhilarating and tonic properties are beyond
description. The entire atmosphere is fragrant with
the pines. Throat and chest are bathed in balm and
healing. There can hardly be any difficulty with the
bronchial and breathing mechanism that cannot find its
cure here. And the charm, the utter enchantment of
living on this rainbow-tinted cañon, a mile and a half
deep, thirteen miles across at this "Bright Angel" point
(and this is its narrowest place), the joy of life is to steep
one's self in the atmosphere of enchanting loveliness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
and this perpetual play of color is an experience that
finds no interpretation in language.</p>

<p>On first alighting from the branch of the Santa Fé that
runs from Williams, Arizona, to Bright Angel, at the head
of Bright Angel Trail on the Grand Cañon,&mdash;a three
hour's ride of transcendent beauty among the purple peaks
of the San Francisco mountains,&mdash;on first stepping from
the train up the terrace to the beautiful "El Tovar"
built on the very rim of the cañon, one objects strenuously
to entering the hotel. His eye has caught the
Vision,&mdash;a "celestial Inferno bathed in soft fires?" or
the "Promised Land?" or the mystical vision that John
saw on the Island of Patmos? The hotel would, presumably,
remain; but this spectacle,&mdash;what can it be save a
mirage, one never seen before on earth and perhaps not
to be too confidently anticipated in Paradise? Would
such a picture remain? Can one safely leave a sunset
which is all a miracle of splendor while he goes in to
dine? Can he safely turn away from the heavens when
a young moon at night is winging her way down the sky
and expect to find her midway in the heavens? And
could one safely leave this most marvellous scene of all
while he should bestow himself in his rooms?</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p318.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ZIGZAG, BRIGHT ANGEL TRAIL, GRAND CAÑON, ARIZONA</p>

<p>Could it be, in the very nature of things, any more permanent
than any other momentary revelation of an enchanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
hour that would fade into the darkness as night
came on, like the splendor of a sunset, the color-scheme
of a rainbow, or the glory and the freshness of a dream?</p>

<p>Instead, the Grand Cañon prefigures itself to one as an
apparition, and while he may gaze upon it under all
changing lights of dawn, of noonday, of sunset&mdash;and of
moonlight&mdash;he cannot come to any realization that it is
there all the time. His room in the hotel may look out
into it and over it; and, waking in the night, he rises and
leans out of his window to see if it is still there. One
does not expect a vision of the New Jerusalem, a palpitating,
changing, flaming, throbbing sea of color&mdash;in its
rose-reds, its greens, its amber, gold, and purple&mdash;to remain
like a field or a forest. It seems a thing of conditions,
visible at one moment, vanished, perchance, the
next.</p>

<p>Think of a chasm a mile and a half deep, from thirteen
to eighteen miles wide, and as long as from Boston to
New York&mdash;two hundred miles! Think of it again as
not merely a deep, dark chasm, but as filled with the
most wonderful architectural effects in the sandstone formations
which simulate Chinese pagodas, temples, altars,
cathedrals, domes, and towers so perfectly that one is
incredulous of the fact that their shaping is nature's
work alone. Add to this the color scheme, now an intense
royal purple, again flashes of rose and green and
ivory and a rare blue; or again a "nocturne" in silvery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
gray, with hints of lingering rose and amber shimmering
in the air. Until within a few years the Grand Cañon
was so inaccessible as to quite account for the general
ignorance of this most wonderful scenic phenomenon in
our country, and, indeed, with no exaggeration be it said,
the most wonderful in the entire world. Twenty Yosemites
might be thrown into it and make no impression;
and as for Niagara, it would be a mere tiny waterfall in
comparison.</p>

<p>In the trail leading downward into the cañon the first
level is just five times the height of St. Peter's in Rome,
or the Pyramids of Cheops.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus_p320.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A CLIFF ON BRIGHT ANGEL TRAIL, GRAND CAÑON</p>

<p>From the brink one looks down a mile and a half into
towers and pinnacles; one looks across eighteen miles
in the widest place; and one looks up and down its
tortuous length, as its complicated system of cañons revealed
themselves as far as the eye could see either way.
One gazes, not into a deep, dark cleft, a Titanic royal
gorge, but on and into a sea of color and a wealth of
architectural wonders,&mdash;cathedrals, towers, mosques, pinnacles,
minarets, temples, and balconies exceeding in variety
of design, in extraordinary beauty of grouping and
splendor of color, anything of which one could dream,
even in his most enchanted moments. The red sandstone,
the brilliant white of the limestone luminous under the
setting sun, the green of pine trees or of copper rocks, the
gray and ochre tints of gravel and fallen rocks and débris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
the soft, deep purple mist enveloping all as an atmosphere
in which all these architectural marvels seemed to swim&mdash;the
strange, unearthly splendor of it all&mdash;holds one under
a fascination that can neither be analyzed nor described.
This, then, is "El Grande Cañon de la Colorado." One
stands speechless, breathless, as if transported to some
other planet. Suddenly all life&mdash;everything that floated
in memory&mdash;seemed confused, unreal. Was the past
(whose running series of incident and event and circumstance
already seemed vague) a dream, and was this the
reality? Or had there never been any reality in life before?
Was this a dream, wrought under some untold
spell of enchantment? Would one hear the water nixies
chanting their refrain if he listened? Or was this scene of
Titanic grandeur the abode of Wagner's gods and heroes?
One watched for the sacred fires to flame on Brunhilde's
rock and for Siegfried to appear. One saw the ship
which had borne Tristan on his ill-starred voyage, and
the garden where the lovers confessed their intense and
instant love, and the fatal potion scene rises before him;
and again he is lost in rapt ecstasy as the air seems filled
with the passionate drama of Lilli Lehmann and Alvarez.
For let Ternina and other younger women come and go
in the Wagner music-drama, and yet where will that absolute
perfection of dramatic action, that passionate exaltation
of emotion, ever again attend and invest any singer
as they invest and are identified with Lilli Lehmann?</p>

<p>In this most sublime of all earthly spectacles there are
aërial landscape effects as delicate and evanescent as a
cloud-wreath, or as a fog that advances, wraith-like, to
melt away into dissolving views. "The region is full of
wonders and beauties and sublimities that Shelley's imaginings
do not match in the 'Prometheous Unbound,'"
wrote Charles Dudley Warner.</p>

<p>If the world realized the marvellous effects of this very
Carnival of the Gods, the infinite spaces of the Grand
Cañon itself could not contain all who would eagerly
throng to behold it. The statistical record of the increase
of visitors is rather interesting. In 1900 there were eight
hundred and thirteen; the succeeding year, six thousand
eight hundred and eighty-three; while in 1903 the number
increased to nearly one hundred and twenty-eight thousand.
Since that date the number of visitors has multiplied
itself after the fashion of compound interest. The
establishment of all the conveniences and comforts, not
to say luxuries, of modern travel may be one of the
most potent factors in this increase of visitors. Until
within five years the Grand Cañon could only be reached
by a stage ride of seventy miles through the Coconino
Forest,&mdash;whose dim gray twilight reminds one of the
forests of Fontainebleau,&mdash;and which drive, however romantically
beautiful, was attended with too great terrestrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
discomfort to commend it to general public service. Until
1906 the hotel accommodations, also, while offering a
modest comfort, were essentially primitive; while now the
superb new Harvey hostelry, "El Tovar," built at a cost
of a quarter of a million dollars (and the Harvey name is
a synonym in the West for everything admirable in dining
cars, refreshment stands, and hotels), insures to every
traveller any degree of luxurious comfort he requires.
Even the man who, after visiting all the enchanted points
in the Land of Enchantment, in its prehistoric period of
twenty years ago before Pullman cars climbed the mountain
peaks and the Waldorf-Astoria type of hotels sprang
up, the man who, after a trip through these wonders of
the world, returned to New York and declared that he
would rather see an electric bell and a bath than all the
grandeur between Pike's Peak and the Pacific, would now
be fully reconciled to Western sojourns. He would find
his electric bell and his bath to be as much a matter of
course as in Fifth Avenue, besides also finding that there
were spectacles,&mdash;as that of the Garden of the Gods,
Cheyenne Cañon, the Petrified Forests, the Grand Cañon,
and the Los Angeles electric trolley system (which quite
deserves to rank with the modern "Seven Wonders" of the
world), and which Fifth Avenue by no means provided for
her votaries. In fact, "El Tovar" is so inclusive of comfort
as to be fairly a feature of the cañon, commanding, on
one side, a magnificence of prospect without parallel in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
world in the mighty chasm on whose brink it stands, on the
other side the fragrant Coconino pine forest,&mdash;the largest
belt of pine timber in the United States, and which has
been made a government forest reservation.</p>

<p>There is now a project to erect a memorial to Major
John W. Powell, the pioneer explorer of the Grand
Cañon, to be placed on the rim at the head of Bright
Angel Trail at El Tovar. This most fitting plan to
honor the name of the great scientist and explorer whose
research contributed the first authoritative knowledge
of the cañon is the thought of the American Scenic
Association, which will petition Congress to grant the
requisite appropriation. No monument to human greatness
could be more ideally placed than this to perpetually
repeat to every visitor and sojourner the name of the
explorer who successfully achieved the most startling and
heroic journey in all history,&mdash;that made through the
complete extent of the Grand Cañon.</p>

<p>It was in 1869 that Major Powell, with four boats
and nine men, inaugurated this expedition, starting from
Green River City in Utah. He was dissuaded and importuned
in the most urgent way by those most familiar
with the region not to attempt the feat. The Indians
especially insisted that no boat could live in any one
of the score of rapids to be passed. There was also a
tradition that for some hundreds of miles the river lost
itself in the earth, and Major Powell and his men would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
thus be imprisoned within a Titantic fortress from which
escape would be impossible. But men of destiny do not
hesitate when they are led to great achievements. Major
Powell set out on May 24, 1869, with his nine men and
four boats, and landed on August 3, with four men
and two boats, at the mouth of the Virgin River, after
having sailed the boiling torrent of the Colorado River,
at the bottom of the cañon, for more than a thousand
miles. Mr. C. A. Higgins characterizes this feat as "the
most wonderful geological and spectacular phenomenon
known to mankind."</p>

<p>The first authentic knowledge of the existence of the
Grand Cañon dates back to August of 1540, when the
Spanish friar, Alvar Nuñez, after years of romantic wanderings
among the pueblos of the Southwest, returned
to Mexico with tales of this mighty chasm. Coronado,
who had discovered the Seven Cities of Cibola (of which
now only Zuñi remains), ordered Garcia Lopez to take a
band of men and Indian guides and search for this chasm,
which he succeeded in discovering; with the more difficulty,
surely, in that one has to gain its very rim before he has
hardly an intimation of its proximity. The spectacle of
the cañon always presents itself as a sudden surprise. It
was not, however, until 1884 that, by the building of the
great transcontinental line, the Santa Fé, the Grand
Cañon became accessible. Then for some twenty years it
was reached, as has already been noted, by stage from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
Flagstaff. Now one can travel in his sleeper without
change from Chicago to El Tovar, and thousands of
tourists annually visit the extraordinary scene. Not the
least of the interesting data regarding the cañon is this
gulf of more than three hundred years that divides its discovery
from its taking rank as the most phenomenal scenic
resort of the world. The mills of the gods grind slowly.
The visitors to the Grand Cañon present singularly cosmopolitan
groups, there being hardly a country in the world
that is not represented at some time during the year.</p>

<p>For the cañon has all seasons for its own. It is almost
as much of an object of winter as of summer pilgrimage.
One season is found, on the whole, to be almost as enjoyable
here as another. It is cool in summer, and it is
warm and sunny in winter. Sometimes there is a fairy
snowfall, but hardly more lasting than a spring frost,
and when it comes it only adds another flitting variety
to the stupendous scene.</p>

<p>With untold tons of the water of the Colorado River
pouring itself in torrents through the bottom of the
cañon, all the water used for the table, for toilet, and
for laundry purposes has to be brought from a distance
of a hundred and twenty miles, and twenty thousand
gallons are in daily use. An electric-light plant furnishes
brilliant illumination.</p>

<p>The Hopi House, built in imitation of an Indian
pueblo, with a group of quaintly garbed Hopi Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
within in attendance, is a curiosity; and besides the
Hopis there are Navajos and Supais coming to sell their
handiwork,&mdash;that of pottery, silver ornaments, blankets,
and baskets. Cataract Cañon, forty miles from El Tovar,
is the home of the Supais, and it is a place that well
repays visiting for an entirely new point of view of the
vast cañon that it affords. There are peaceful Indians
to be seen daily riding their horses through the pine
woods, journeying from El Tovar to Grand View, to
"Hance's Trail," to "Moran's Point," and other localities,
to sell or barter their wares. One old Indian who seems
to roam about alone has developed an ingenious manner of
procuring food when he is hungry. He enters the hotel
office and seeks the proprietor himself, recognizing with unerring
instinct that this gentleman's liberal endowment of
sympathy and unfailing generosity never permits him to
"turn down" a request for aid. The wily old savage seeks
him out and makes conspicuous overtures of his affection.</p>

<p>"You is heap my son; pale face heap my son!" the
dusky visitor declares, and when this assurance is emphasized
to the proprietor he realizes that it means he is
"heap my son" because his visitor is hungry. These outbursts

Once fed he is off, and thinks no more of the man whom
he assured that he was "heap my son" until hunger again

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>So the little trifles and pleasantries of the <i>comédie
humaine</i> assert their place in the general life even on the
rim of the sublime spectacle of the Carnival of the Gods.</p>

<p>For more than two hundred miles the cañon offers its
innumerable panoramas, no one ever duplicating that of
another. There are thousands of cañons in it&mdash;it is a
complicated system of colossal cañons. Every wall is an
aggregation of hundreds of walls. Every pinnacle is
formed of hundreds of pinnacles. When the sun shines
in splendor on the vermilion walls, the glory is almost
beyond what man can bear. When from the trail below
a star seems to float in the air and rest on the verge of
the cliff, what words can convey any image of this ineffable
beauty?</p>

<p>The cloud-effects are another of the phases of faëry. A
rain creates a panorama of clouds creeping out of one
cañon and flying into another, all "as if they had souls
and wills of their own," says Major Powell; and he adds,
"In the imagination the clouds belong to the sky, and
when they are in the cañon the skies come down into the
gorges and cling to the cliffs and lift them up to immeasurable
heights, for the sky must still be far away; thus
they lend infinity to the walls." The cañon mirrors the
color and the state of the sky as water does. This is one
of the most curious facts connected with it. "Yet form
and color do not exhaust all the divine qualities of the
Grand Cañon," continues Major Powell; "it is the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
of music. The river thunders in perpetual roar, swelling
in floods of music when the storm-gods play upon the
rocks, and fading away in soft and low murmurs when the
infinite blue of heaven is unveiled.... The adamant
foundations of the earth have been wrought into a sublime
harp upon which the clouds of heaven play with
mighty tempests or with gentle showers."</p>

<p>Major Powell, the explorer and practically the modern
discoverer of the cañon, remains its most complete
interpreter. His journal narrating that remarkable
voyage through the Colorado River in a region "more
difficult to traverse than the Alps or the Himalayas,"
is fairly an epic in American literature. He had the
vision of the painter and the heart of the poet.
He felt that infinitely complex variety of the cañon,
and he read its sublime inscriptions on a scroll not
made with hands. He pictures one feature especially
that has hardly been touched by other writers,&mdash;that
of the perpetually changing aspects. "One moment
as we looked out over the landscape," he writes, "the
atmosphere seemed to be trembling and moving about,
giving the impression of an unstable land: plains and
hills and cliffs and distant mountains seemed vaguely
to be floating about in a trembling, wave-rocked sea;
and patches of landscape would seem to float away and
be lost, and then reappear.... The craggy buttes
seem dancing about.... The sun shone in splendor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
on the vermilion walls. Shaded into green and gray
when the rocks were lichened over, the river filled the
channel from wall to wall, and the cañon opened like
a beautiful doorway to a region of glory. But at
evening, when the sun was going down and the shadows
were settling in the cañon, the scarlet gleams and roseate
hues, blended with tints of green and gray, slowly
changed to sombre brown above and black shadows crept
over them from below.... Lying down, one looked up
through the cañon and saw that only a little of the blue
heavens appeared overhead,&mdash;a crescent of blue sky with
but two or three constellations peering down upon us.
Soon I saw a bright star that appeared to rest on the
verge of the cliffs overhead, and, as it moved up from the
rock, I almost wondered that it did not fall, and indeed it
appeared as if swayed down by its own weight. The star
appeared to be <i>in</i> the cañon, so high were the walls."</p>

<p>So the wonderful story of Major Powell's runs on of
these atmospheric phenomena of the cañon, effects that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">"... give to seas and sunset skies</div>
<div class="verse">Their unspent beauty of surprise."</div>
</div></div>

<p>It is from Bright Angel Trail that the Grand Cañon is
the most accessible. Parties of men and women, mounted
on sure-footed burros, go down this trail with their
guides&mdash;apparently under the special protection of the
bright angels of the celestial host, as no accident has ever,
thus far, occurred. Prof. George Wharton James notes, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
his invaluable work on the Grand Cañon,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that this trail
was originally used by the Havasupai Indians and that
the rude irrigating canals that conveyed water from an adjacent
spring to a so-called Indian Garden in the near vicinity
are still to be seen. The view from the head of Bright
Angel Trail is one of vast extent and a peculiar sublimity.
Buddha Temple is a colossal pile that rises in isolated
grandeur, and near it is Buddha Cloister. An impressive
tower of rock rising in the cañon bears the honored name
of Agassiz. Isis Temple and the Temple of Brahma are
within the range of the eye from this point. The perfectly
transparent air, and that absence of aërial vibration
that characterizes the atmosphere of Arizona, conspire to
invest all distance with magic illusion. Looking across
the thirteen miles of the cañon's abyss from Bright Angel
Trail, the opposite rim hardly seems farther away than
the distance of three or four city blocks. Isis Temple is
said to be as great in mass as the mountainous part of
Mt. Washington, and the summit of Isis looks down six
thousand feet into the depths of a chasm, the ledges on
the side being "as impracticable as the face of Bunker
Hill Monument."</p>

<p>It is a noticeable fact, and one which the general
reader may regard with quiet amusement, that all the
writers who even attempt to allude to the Grand Cañon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
quote copiously from each other; and this is the almost
inevitable instinct of each, in order to reinforce himself
with authority for statements which, to those who have
not themselves gazed upon this Carnival of the Gods,
would sound incredible even to the verge of the wildest
extravaganza. Major Powell's vivid transcription of his
thrilling journey through the cañon, sailing through the
boiling, rushing river whose torrents constantly threatened
to engulf his boats,&mdash;Major Powell's transcription stands
for itself alone; it was not only the pictured scenes of a
writer, but the scientific report of an official government
explorer; but since this,&mdash;and from Major Powell's narrative
every writer invariably quotes,&mdash;since this, the
writers quote from each other; they use each other's
statements as evidence which they cite in order to support
their own statements regarding a marvel so unspeakably
phenomenal that the most literal and statistical description
reads like an Arabian Nights romance. Then, too,
the array of pen-pictures is interesting. A writer who
coined wonderful descriptive phrases is Mr. C. A. Higgins.
Of the silent transformations of the cañon when it "sinks
into mysterious purple shadow" he said: "The far Shinumo
Altar is tipped with a golden ray, and against a leaden
horizon the long line of the Echo Cliffs reflects a soft brilliance
of indescribable beauty, a light that, elsewhere, surely
never was on sea or land. Then darkness falls," he continues,
"and should there be a moon, the scene in part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
revives in silver light a thousand spectral forms projected
from inscrutable gloom; dreams of mountains, as in their
sleep they brood on things eternal." Others who have
written of the Grand Cañon are: Harriet Monroe, whose
poet's pen is dipped in the colors of an artist's palette;
George Wharton James; and Mr. Charles S. Gleed, a distinguished
lawyer of Topeka, who thus described the
Cañon's wonders:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Surrendering our minds to the magic spell of that mighty
chasm, what pictures troop before us! Yonder see Gibraltar,
giant sentinel of the Mediterranean. There on long ledges
are St. Peter's and St. Paul's, Niagara, the Pyramids, and the
Tower of Pisa. Bracketed beyond are the great parliament
houses of the world. Down below behold in life size the
lesser mountains of our own land,&mdash;Washington, Monadnock,
Mansfield, Lookout, and a thousand others. See in the distance
a million colored pictures of the Alps, the Adirondacks,
and the Sierras. On endless shelves, this way and that,
behold the temples and cathedrals, the castles and fortresses
of all time. See vast armies, the armies of the ages, winding
up the slopes, and great navies man&oelig;uvring in the mirage-like
distance. Here, indeed, the giant mind of Dante would
have found new worlds to conquer; and Homer would have
dreamed new dreams of gods and men, love and war, life and
death, heaven and hell."</p></blockquote>

<p>Hamlin Garland, in one of his prose-poems, has said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The clouds and the sunset, the moonrise and the storm, will
transform it into a splendor no mountain range can surpass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
Peaks will shift and glow, walls darken, crags take fire, and
gray-green mesas, dimly seen, take on the gleam of opalescent
lakes of mountain water. The traveller who goes out to
the edge and peers into the great abyss sees but one
phase out of hundreds. If he is fortunate, it may be one of
its most beautiful combinations of color and shadow. But
to know it, to feel its majesty, one should camp in the
bottom and watch the sunset and the moonrise while the
river marches from its lair like an angry lion."</p></blockquote>

<p>Robert Brewster Stanton, a civil engineer whose original
work has brought him prominently before the scientific
world, followed Major Powell's explorations, twenty years
later, with a surveying company of his own organization,&mdash;and
Mr. Stanton is, indeed, the only explorer who has
made the continuous journey the entire length of the
Colorado River which Major Powell navigated for a thousand
miles. It was in May of 1889 that Mr. Stanton and
his men initiated this daring feat, and of one phase of the
appearance of the cañon Mr. Stanton's glowing, eloquent
pen recorded:</p>

<p>"Those terrifying, frowning walls <i>are moving, are
changing</i>! A new light is not only creeping over them,
but is coming out from their very shadows. See those
flattened slopes above the dark sandstone on top the
granite; even at this very moment they are <i>being colored</i>
in gorgeous stripes of horizontal layers of yellow, brown,
white, green, and purple.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>"What means this wondrous change? Wherein lies
this secret of the great cañon?</p>

<p>"After living in it and with it for so many weeks and
months, I lost all thought of the great chasm as being
only a huge rock mass, carved into its many intricate forms
by ages of erosion. It became to me what it has ever
since remained, and what it really is,&mdash;a living, moving,
sentient being!</p>

<p>"The Grand Cañon is not a solitude. It is a living,
moving, pulsating being, ever changing in form and color,
pinnacles and towers springing into being out of unseen
depths. From dark shades of brown and black, scarlet
flames suddenly flash out and then die away into stretches
of orange and purple. How can such a shifting, animated
glory be called 'a thing'? It is a being, and among its
upper battlements, its temples, its amphitheatres, its cathedral
spires, its monuments and its domes, and in the deeper
recesses of its inner gorge its spirit, its soul, the very spirit
of the living God himself, lives and moves and has its
being."</p>

<p>Mr. C. M. Skinner, of the "Brooklyn Eagle," impressively
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... After the sky colors, too, have faded, you are about
to turn away, lingering, regretting, when&mdash;again, a wonder;
for new colors, deep, tender, solemn, flow up along the
painted walls, as night brims out of the deep. The bottom
grows vague and misty, but each Walhalla is steeped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
purple as soft as the bloom of grapes. When day is wholly
gone and the cañon has become to the eye a mere feeling or
impression of depth and space, walk out on some lonely
point. The slopes, thirteen miles away, are visible as gray
walls, distinct from the black cliffs, and on the hither side the
trees are clear against the snow. No night is absolute in
blackness, but as we look it seems as though the cañon was
lighted from within. It is an abyss of shadow and mystery.
There is a sadness in the cañon, as in all great things of
nature, that removes it from human experience. We have
seen the utmost of the world's sublimity, and life is fuller
from that hour."</p></blockquote>

<p>All these and many other transcriptions of its glory
form a picture gallery which each lover of the Grand
Cañon prizes as among his choicest possessions. Thomas
Moran, the artist, has painted many scenes from the
cañon, one of these paintings having been placed in
the Capitol in Washington, where it is the object of
the admiration and the wonder of the endless procession
of visitors who throng the nation's centre. Painter and
poet and prophet make their pilgrimages to this one
stupendous Marvel of Nature. To the prophets and the
poets of every century and every age it flashes its responsive
message; and the worshipper at the shrine of this
Infinite Beauty, this sublimest Majesty, can but feel,
with Mr. Higgins,&mdash;that poetic lover of the vast Southwest,
the lover of music and literature and art and nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
whose beautiful life on earth closed in 1900, but whose
charm of presence still pervades the scenes he loved and
memorialized,&mdash;with this lofty and poetic recorder of
nature one can but say of the Grand Cañon: "Never was
picture more harmonious, never flower more exquisitely
beautiful. It flashes instant communication of all that
architecture and painting and music for a thousand years
have gropingly striven to express. It is the soul of Michael
Angelo and of Beethoven."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In retrospective glance over a very midsummer night's
dream of the ineffable glory and beauty of wanderings
from Pike's Peak to the Pacific there stands out to the
mental vision one treasured possession whose loveliness exceeds
that of all scenic landscape; which is more luminous
and crystal clear than the luminous atmosphere of beautiful
Colorado or glowing Arizona; which is more enduring
in its changelessness than even the Petrified Forests
or the mighty precipices of the Grand Cañon; which is
invested with all the etherial splendor of that brilliant
young city which the Spanish conquerors knew as <i>Pueblo
de la Reine de los Angeles</i>: which is as sacred in its nature
as are the sacred legends of the Holy Faith of St.
Francis. This treasured possession is that of the friendships
formed during this enchanted journey; of the generous
kindness, the bountiful hospitality; the exquisite
courtesy and grace constantly received from each and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
with an unfailing uniformity, including those in widely varying
relations and pursuits; those who, according to outer
standards, are the more, or the less, fortunate in power, resources,
or development,&mdash;the treasured possession of all
this sweet and gracious friendliness is imperishable; and
in this priceless and precious gift, which is not only a
treasure for the life that now is, but also for the life
which is to come, is there crystallized all the charm of
summer wanderings in the Land of Enchantment.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
